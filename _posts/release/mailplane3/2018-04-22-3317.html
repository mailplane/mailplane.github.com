<div class="item">
    <p>
        Sorry for updating in quick succession but the last update caused a few issues
        which we didn't catch in our tests before.
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Fixed characters ghosting out while typing and reappearing once hitting return.</li>
        <li>Fixed crash which started to happen regularly since the last update.</li>
        <li>Fixed 'Download failed' issue.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
