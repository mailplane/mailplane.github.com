<p>Great review on the Malaysian myMacBUZZ website:</p>

<blockquote>
My favorite email client was updated to 2.0 early this week. Think of Mailplane as a web browser that only loads Gmail or Google Apps mail. Mailplane 2.0 adds full support for Gmail 2 and a whopping 41 new features which any Gmail power user will love.

<p>The author then presents <a href="http://mymacbuzz.com/2008/12/12/mailplane-20">his favorite new features in full detail.</a>
