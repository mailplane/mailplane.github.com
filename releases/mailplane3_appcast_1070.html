	<p>Mailplane 3.5.6 contains a number of improvements and fixes for OS X 10.7, OS X 10.8 and OS X 10.9 platforms. <a href="http://www.mailplaneapp.com/releases/mailplane3.html#2106">More...</a></p>
	<p>Keep in mind that we're not able to publish all features on those platforms anymore and Gmail might cease to work there because Google is constantly dropping older systems. Whenever possible we suggest to upgrade to the latest OS X version.</p>
	<p><strong>Attention:</strong> Customers who already downloaded 3.6.0 will lose support for the new <a href="https://www.google.com/inbox/">Google Inbox</a> because we can't fully support it anymore on systems lower than OS X 10.10. This is also the reason why it is called 3.5.6 instead of 3.6.x despite being superior to 3.6.0 from a fixes and improvements standpoint. The bottom line is that we suggest to update to Mailplane 3.5.6 if you use regular Gmail or update to the latest OS X version if you want to use the new <a href="https://www.google.com/inbox/">Google Inbox</a>.</p>
