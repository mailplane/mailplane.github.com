Google Calendar has two new options to communicate your work availability.

## Create repeating out of office entries

Select "automatically decline meetings" when you create a repeating "out of office" entry. This will send a decline 
notification if someone tries to schedule a meeting during that "out of office" period.

## Split your working hours into multiple segments a day

Use segmentable working hours to let people know when you don't plan to work during the day. Working hours are visible
on your calendar when someone schedules a meeting with you.
