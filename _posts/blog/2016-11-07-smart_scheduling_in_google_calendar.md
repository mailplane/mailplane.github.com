“Find a time” makes it easier to find a free time slot and room if you're scheduling a meeting.

It is already available on iOS and Android and should [come to the web](https://gmail.googleblog.com/2016/09/save-time-with-smart-scheduling-in-Google-Calendar.html) (and thus Mailplane) by the end of the year.
