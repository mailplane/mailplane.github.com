	Auto-Refresh is connected to the Notifier and updates Gmail if standing inside the overview. This is very useful to get new emails immediately. But sometimes the refresh happened too often and led to unnecessary and disturbing focus losses. Now it does only refresh if the inbox counter differs from the one of the notifier (per account).
