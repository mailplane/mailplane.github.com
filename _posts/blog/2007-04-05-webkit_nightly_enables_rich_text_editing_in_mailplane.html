<p><img class="imageStyle" alt="MailplaneRichText" src="/assets/blog/page5_blog_entry6_1.jpg" width="631" height="399"/>With the latest and greatest Webkit version, rich text editing is now available in Mailplane. By default, Mailplane uses Webkit that comes with your Mac OS X. In Tiger this is limited to plain text editing. But now, you can download the latest Webkit build and tell Mailplane about it by setting a preference.<br /><br />BTW: How do you like the line "Invite Apple to Gmail" in the screenshot - sweet isn't it?</p>
