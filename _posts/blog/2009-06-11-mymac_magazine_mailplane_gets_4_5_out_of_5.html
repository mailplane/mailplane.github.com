<p><a href="http://www.mymac.com/showarticle.php?id=3682">Scott Willsey (MyMac.com) wrote a great review about Mailplane:</a> </p>

<blockquote>Mailplane has changed my entire mindset about email. I no longer deal with sync issues between computers. I no longer worry about managing local copies of everything. If you can wrap your brain around having your email in the cloud, or even if you just have a few Gmail accounts you want to manage in addition to some other email accounts that you do deal with through a regular email client, Mailplane makes things smooth and easy for you, just like using a regular email client. I recommend it to any heavy Gmail user on the Mac.</blockquote>
