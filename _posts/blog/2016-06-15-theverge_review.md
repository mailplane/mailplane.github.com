Mailplane has had the pleasure of being reviewed by Thomas Ricker from The Verge last month. It's about the plainness of Mailplane in the sense that it gives you an unadulterated Gmail experience.

We're very glad for that review because it perfectly resembles our main motivation behind Mailplane. We try to stay pragmatic and provide an app which makes plain Gmail as convenient as possible. Gmail isn't the most beautiful thing in the world and so isn't Mailplane. But we've been using Gmail since more than a decade and it still works for us without any major flaws. The 'archive instead of delete' approach was revolutionary back then and still is to a certain degree. Search works flawlessly and you can simply sign in without having to fiddle around with IMAP/POP/SMTP settings.
