MailPlane adds back the features you&rsquo;ve come to rely on your desktop mail client for, like Growl alerts when you get a new e-mail, the ability to drag a file to its icon and have a new e-mail open up with the file attached. Or the ability to select a batch of photos in iPhoto and click &ldquo;e-mail&rdquo;.</p></blockquote><br />It's a great read, check out the full <a href="http://www.macworld.com.au/blogs/view/cloud-computing-327" rel="self">article</a>.</p>
