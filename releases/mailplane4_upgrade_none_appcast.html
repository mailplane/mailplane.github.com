<p>
    It is packed with new features and looks better than ever.
</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Annotation &amp; Shapes</strong>: Get your point across with fewer words using annotations and shapes.</li>
    <li><strong>Notifications with Actions</strong>: Archive a message or write a quick reply directly from new email notifications.</li>
    <li><strong>New Extensions</strong>: Extend Gmail and become more productive.</li>
    <li><strong>Search Everywhere</strong>: Search all your accounts at once.</li>
    <li><strong>... and more</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
    <strong>Unfortunately you're not able to install it on your Mac.</strong> Make sure to run at least macOS 10.12+ (Sierra).
</p>

<p>
    This will be a <strong>paid upgrade</strong> but you can trial it 15 days for free. If you don't like it, you can revert back to Mailplane 3 at any time.
