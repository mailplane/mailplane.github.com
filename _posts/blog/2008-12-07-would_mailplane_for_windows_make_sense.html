<p>Mailplane for Mac is quite popular, and it fills a real need. It makes many users more productive. Would Mailplane for Windows make sense? Would Windows users install a client application to get more out of Gmail?</p>

<p>If many people answer this question with YES, then we would be ready to create a Windows version:</p>

<ul>
<li>It would run on Vista and XP (Service Pack 2)</li>
<li>It would cost about the same as the Mac version</li>
<li>There would be a private beta for selected users</li>
</ul>
