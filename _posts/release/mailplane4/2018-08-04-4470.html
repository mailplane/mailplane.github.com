    Hooray! Mailplane 4 has landed.<br/>
    <br/>
    After running Mailplane for more than 10 years, we still believe that web services like Gmail need specialized
    applications that make them efficient to use. That’s why we built Mailplane 4 – the best Mailplane we’ve ever
    made.<br/>
    <br/>
    We hope you like it as much as we do! Check out some of its new features <a href="/mailplane_4_what_is_new.html">here</a>.<br/>
    <br/>
    Cheers,<br/>
