<p>For many users, the Buzz inbox notifications got too noisy. According to <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/better-controls-for-buzz-in-your-inbox.html" target="_blank">this article on the official Gmail blog</a>, Google has worked on two improvements:</p>

<blockquote>

<h4>1) Settings to control what gets sent to your inbox</h4>
From the Buzz tab of Gmail Settings, you’ll be able to choose whether the following buzz items get sent to your inbox:
<ul>
<li>Comments on your posts</li>
<li>Comments on posts after you comment on them</li>
<li>Comments on posts after you are @replied on them</li>
</ul>

<h4>2) Explanations for why posts get sent to your inbox and an easy-to-find “Mute” link</h4>
You'll see a new message at the top of each post in your inbox that explains why it’s there: someone commented on your post, you were @replied, etc. We’ve also added an easy-to-find “mute” link that will stop subsequent comments from bringing the conversation back to your inbox.
