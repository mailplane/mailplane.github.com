<p>Make image attachment smaller and convert them to a format everybody can open.</p>

<p>Todays digital cameras produce very big photos, suitable for creating high quality prints. When you send them by Email on the other hand, they should be reduced in size and converted to JPEG.</p>

<p>Normally when you attach one or pictures (using drag and drop or using the clipboard), you'll get this dialog to optimize your pictures:</p>

<ol>
<li><em>Optimize picture attachments</em> controls all other settings on this page. If turned off, the picture will be attached "as-is" and will not be modified in any way.</li>
<li>This preview shows the pictures which are attached.</li>
<li>Choose the picture size (Large, Medium, or Small)</li>
<li>Select the desired quality setting, less quality means smaller size.</li>
<li>Check <em>Don't show this dialog again</em> if you're always using the same settings. You can always turn it back on in <em>Preferences > Photos.</em></li>
<li>Click "Attach" button to attach the pictures.</li>
</ol>

<div class="bbox"><div class="tip"></div><p class="title">Tip: Command-Drop turns off optimization</p><p>If you like to send files "as-is" without any change, but you don't want to change the default settings, you can hold down the Command key while dropping the file. No dialog will be shown as a result.</p></div>

<h3>Preferences</h3>

<p>All settings are remembered for the next time you attach pictures. You can access the settings in <em>Preferences > Photos:</em></p>
