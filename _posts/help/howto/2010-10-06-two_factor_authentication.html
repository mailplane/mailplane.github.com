<p>Mailplane 2 doesn't support 'two-factor' authentication. Please use Mailplane 3.</p>

<p>Setting up two-factor login with Mailplane 3 is as simple as it is within a browser. You can simply visit <a href="http://support.google.com/accounts/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=180744" target="_blank">Google's help page</a> and follow their directions.</p>
