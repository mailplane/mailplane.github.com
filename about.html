			<p>The Mailplane team is comprised of three people. Lars is responsible for the day-to-day operations in Mailplane, Jessica is the Support Ninja and Gor helps out with testing. Our mission is to give you the best Gmail experience on your Mac. </p>
			<h3>Story</h3>
			<p>Ruben has started Mailplane in 2006 on the beautiful Island of Corsica. He called it GmailSender initially, because it was just an iPhoto plugin which attached pictures to a Gmail message. From there, Mailplane grew to a site-specific browser for Gmail which was officially released at the end of 2007.</p>
			<p>At the end of 2010, Lars and Ruben partnered to build Mailplane 3. The mission was to add better account support, integrate Google Calendar and modernize the appearance. As it happens sometimes, we ended up with a complete new Mailplane at the end of 2011. We began an extensive beta period which concluded in April 2013. We hope you'll love Mailplane as much as we do!</p>
