<p>Mailplane 2.0.3 is a free maintenance release. Use <b>Mailplane->Check for update</b> to load it or <a href="/download.html">download it manually.</a></p>

<h3>Release Notes:</h3>

<ul>
<li>WORKAROUND: Authentication problem warning.</li>
<li>CHANGED: ⌘-L "Apply/Remove Label" panel is back.</li>
<li>FIXED: In rare cases external links did open in Mailplane instead of the external browser</li>
<li>CHANGED: Password field is now focused when it is empty.</li>
<li>NEW: Spanish translation by Juan Antonio Vermejo!</li>
<li>UPDATED: Chinese, French, German, Portuguese, and Romanian translations.</li>
</ul>

<h3>⌘-L and the Apply/Remove Label panel</h3>

<p>Many users missed Mailplane's way to apply/remove a label. Now it is back. There are still some items missing (star, inbox, spam) - I hope to bring them back, too.</p>

<p>Tip: Use the 'l' or 'v' keyboard shortcuts, if you prefer the Google way using labels.</p>
