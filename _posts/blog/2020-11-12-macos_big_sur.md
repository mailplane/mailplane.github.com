Apple released macOS Big Sur (10.16) today.

We tested [Mailplane 4.3](https://mailplaneapp.com/releases/mailplane4.html#4846) with MacOS Big Sur and made corrections to ensure compatibility. Unfortunately upcoming Apple Silicon Macs aren't yet supported, but we're working on it. Read more [here](/help/apple_silicon_compatibility.html).
