Gmail started to introduce two new security warnings. Not all affected emails will be dangerous but it helps to decide if replying to or clicking on links in messages is safe.

1. You'll see a question mark in place of the sender's profile photo if a message can't be authenticated.

2. If you receive a message with a link to a dangerous site, you'll see warnings when you click on the link.
