<h4>Improved: Support Google lab features</h4>

<p>See separate blog posts for "Remember the milk", Google Docs * Google Calendar features.</p>

<h4>New: Permanent cookie storage</h4>

<p>To better support the new Google Labs feature, web cookies are now stored on disk. They are located in the "~/Library/Application Support/Mailplane" folder.</p>

<p>This shortens startup and "account switch" time considerably.</p>

<h4>Changed: Sign out</h4>

<p>Sign out now terminates the Google session instead of opening the account drawer.</p>

<h4>Experimental: Open external links in Mailplane</h4>

<p>&#x2318;-click links or buttons to open the web pages inside Mailplane instead of your preferred browser.</p>

<p><strong>Important: This feature is experimental and may be changed or removed in future versions.</strong></p>

<h5>Tips + Tricks:</h5>

<ul>
<li>&#x2325;-Click opens a link in "background"</li>
<li>&#x21E7;-click opens a link in Firefox instead of your preferred browser (Safari, OmniWeb etc.)</li>
</ul>

<h4>Bug fix:</h4>

<p>Unread message counter didn't work correctly when the Gmail settings page was active</p>
