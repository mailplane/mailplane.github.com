"Try The Mac App For Google-holics" is the headline of this witty, easily
read blog review. [Tera](http://teratalks.com/2014/12/try-the-mac-app-for-google-holics) highlights Mailplane's Calendar integration,
which sends notifications and allows you to easily accept invites and
manage your Calendar, as well as the ability to hide Gmail
ads. You can check out her full review [here](http://teratalks.com/2014/12/try-the-mac-app-for-google-holics).

The popular site [thesweetsetup.com](http://thesweetsetup.com/apps/favorite-email-client-os-x) also released a review of their top 3rd
party email apps, and Mailplane made the 'if you love Gmail's web interface' list. Saying, "At its core,
Mailplane is a web browser that just displays the Gmail web interface, but
wrapped around that are numerous niceties that connect everything you
expect out of a Mac app to that interface." They highlight the ability to
use Mac-style shortcuts and some of our great integrations including
Evernote and Omnifocus. You can check out their full review [here](http://thesweetsetup.com/apps/favorite-email-client-os-x).

Happy Holidays!
