<p>Mailplane is now two years old! <a href="/blog/entry/would_you_like_to_become_a_mailplane_test_pilot/">The adventure began March 8th 2007</a> with the search of 200 "test pilots". March, 14th 2007 was the big day: <a href="http://www.macnn.com/articles/07/03/14/mailplane.enters.beta/">After MacNN and TUAW wrote about Mailplane</a>, the 200 seats were gone in an hour. Before midnight on the same day a thousand Gmail users were registered on the waiting list!</p>

<p>Much has happened since then. I owe you a big thank you: Thank you for using Mailplane and thank you for your comments, bug reports, ideas, and feature requests. Without you Mailplane wouldn't exist!</p>

<p>Thanks to the faboulous Mailplane translators Mailplane is now used 15 languages and in 71 countries around the world!</p>
