<p>Read a great Mailplane review this week on freerksmit.com!  Thought I would pass it along!  <BR>

<p><i>Mailplane - the best of both worlds?<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
... Conclusion:  I have grown quite fond of the app. To me it provides a nice crossover between having the benefits of a stand-alone mail application and being able to use all (most) of Gmail's awesome features. Mailplane is probably not for everyone, but if you are a big time Gmail user I definitely recommend it.</i>
