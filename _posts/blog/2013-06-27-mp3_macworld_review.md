We recently received an amazing review from MacWorld. You can [check out the full article](http://www.macworld.com/article/2040658/mac-gems-mailplane-3-melds-gmail-and-your-mac.html), though here is a little tidbit from their article:

>	"I briefly used Mailplane 2.5 a few months back, and Mailplane 3 represents a huge, applause-worthy improvement. Not only does it work flawlessly with Gmail’s recent interface updates, but it’s also considerably more polished in its look and feel than previous Mailplane versions. Big, friendly icons highlight the program’s sleek, silver look, and Mailplane 3 boasts numerous improvements beyond its surface appeal."

>	"I liked working with Mailplane 3, and I admire the hard work its creators put into the new version—it’s definitely the most polished and useful Gmail client I’ve yet tested."

As per usual, please don't hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or comments!
