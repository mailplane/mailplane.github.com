Notifications don't work in Mailplane 3 at the moment if [2-step verification](http://mailplaneapp.com/howto/entry/two_factor_authentication) is enabled.

Google made some changes on their end which broke how we're fetching new messages in the background. We don't like to encourage you turning off 2-step verification but it's the only way to bring notifications back at the moment.

We're currently working on a solution and are very sorry for that interruption.
