Existing customers can continue using it but due to our limited resources we need to shift our focus to Mailplane 3 to give you the best Gmail experience. That means we won't add new features and we can't guarantee that it will run on newer OSX versions or with newer functionalities of Gmail. But we give our best to keep it alive.

You can still download [Mailplane 2 here](http://mailplaneapp.com/download). If you want to buy Mailplane, we suggest to download [Mailplane 3 here](http://mailplaneapp.com). If you like it, you can buy it after an evaluation period of 15 days.
