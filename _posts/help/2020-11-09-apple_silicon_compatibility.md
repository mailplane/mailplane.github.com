Unfortunately we haven't been able to make Mailplane 4 fully compatible with upcoming Apple Silicon Macs, but we're working on it.

It's a major undertaking and might take a few more months until we're ready to share something.
Don't hesitate to write us to [support@mailplaneapp.com](mailto:support@mailplaneapp.com) if you're interested in a preview version.

#### Wait, I already own an Apple Silicon Mac. What should I do?

If you are fortunate enough to already own a Mac with Apple Silicon, we suggest to use Mailplane 3 in the meantime.
We know it sounds strange, but Mailplane 3 uses a web foundation that runs on Apple Silicon Macs without requiring us to do any modifications.
You can [download Mailplane 3 here](https://update.mailplaneapp.com/mailplane_3.php). It works with Mailplane 4 licenses as well.
