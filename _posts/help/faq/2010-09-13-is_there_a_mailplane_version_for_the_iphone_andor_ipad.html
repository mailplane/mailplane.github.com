<p>Mailplane is a Mac-only application. There are currently no plans for an iPhone or iPad version. </p>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> <a href="http://www.usemailroom.com">Try Mailroom</a> for the iPhone. It is an excellent Gmail client for the iPhone providing multiple accounts and access to your iPhone address book.</p>
