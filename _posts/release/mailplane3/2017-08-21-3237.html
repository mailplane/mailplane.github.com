	Use "Mail > Go to > Add Bookmark..." to save frequent searches or links to individual messages in Gmail. You can then navigate to those bookmarks via "Mail > Go to > Navigate...".
	It's intended as replacement for the <a href="https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2017/03/updates-in-g-suite-to-streamline-hangouts-and-gmail.html" target="_blank">retiring Quick Links</a> lab feature.

	Gmail did also <a href="https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2017/03/updates-in-g-suite-to-streamline-hangouts-and-gmail.html" target="_blank">retire the Quote Selected Text</a> lab feature. We went ahead and built a replacement for it.
	Simply select text in Mailplane and press either "Mail > Reply" (⌘-R) or "Mail > Reply All" (⌥-⌘-R).

	Apple made macOS 10.13 Beta available via their <a href="https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram" target="_blank">Beta Software Program</a>.
