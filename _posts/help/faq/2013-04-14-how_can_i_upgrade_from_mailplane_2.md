Simply [download Mailplane 3](http://update.mailplaneapp.com/mailplane_3.php) and go to **'Mailplane 3 > License...'**. The license dialog will take care of everything else. Below is a detailed guide if you need some help along the way.

### Before October 1 2012

1. Install Mailplane 2 from AppStore if you haven't already. (Open AppStore, go to Purchases and press 'Install')
2. Open Mailplane 3 and choose menu Mailplane 3 > License...
3. Mailplane 3 will automatically detect Mailplane 2. Press '20% Update Discount' on the right.

### On or after October 1 2012

Send us your AppStore/iTunes receipt to <a href="mailto:support@mailplaneapp.com">support@mailplaneapp.com</a>. We'll issue you a free Mailplane 3 license.
