Apple released macOS Sierra yesterday. You can read more about it [here](https://www.apple.com/macos/high-sierra/).

Mailplane 3 runs on macOS High Sierra. Make sure you're on the latest version (3.7.0 or later) by going to `Mailplane 3 > Check for Updates...` or downloading it [here](http://update.mailplaneapp.com/mailplane_3.php) before you upgrade to macOS High Sierra because older versions won't start.

Enjoy!
