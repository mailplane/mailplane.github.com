OmniFocus is a great "Getting Things Done" tool and with Mailplane you can easily create tasks based on Gmail conversations.

1. Install [OmniFocus 2 for Mac](http://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) if you haven't done already.

2. Open a conversation in Mailplane

3. Select some text you'd like to see in the note section of the new task. Mailplane copies the current message if you don't select a text.

4. Perform `Save to OmniFocus` from the `Edit` menu.<br/>

5. Edit the newly created OmniFocus task and press Save<br/>
