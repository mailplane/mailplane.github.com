<p>Do like to control the photo optimization settings each time you attach files? Then you'll like this new feature:<br />The dialog shows each time you attach files and allow to enable/disable optimization and allow you to set the same properties as in the "Photos" preferences.<br /><br /><img class="imageStyle" alt="PictureAttachmentSheet" src="/assets/blog/PictureAttachmentSheet.png" width="595" height="412"/><br /><br /><ol class="arabic-numbers"><li>Picture preview: If you attached more than one picture, the display changes every three seconds</li><li>Enable/Disable Optimizations, set quality and size</li><li>Attach pictures</li><li>In case you never change the settings, disable this sheet. You can always enable it in "Photos" preferences.</li></ol><br />Tip: If you press the command key while performing a  drag and drop operation, the files aren't optimized and the dialog isn't shown.<br /></p>
