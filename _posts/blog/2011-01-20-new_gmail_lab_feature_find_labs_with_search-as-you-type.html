<p>Another lab Gmail feature has become available. This one makes the lab easier to manage:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Have you ever found it just a little bit tricky to find what you were looking for on the Gmail Labs Settings page? Scrolling was ok when there were a handful of Labs, but now that there are over 50 it’s another story. A lunchtime discussion made us realize that having to rely on the browser’s search function or endless scrolling makes it hard to find the Labs features you want. So another Gmail engineer named Manu and I decided take an afternoon and address this. The result is an addition to the Settings page which filters the visible Labs as you type.</p>

<p>You can also link directly to the search results (e.g. http://mail.google.com/mail#settings/labs/video) if you’d like.</p>
