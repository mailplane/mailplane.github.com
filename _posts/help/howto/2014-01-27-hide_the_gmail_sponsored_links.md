There are three different ways to remove the "sponsored links" at the right hand side of a conversation.


Upgrade your Gmail account
---

Use Google's [payed Gmail service](http://www.google.com/apps/intl/en/business/index.html) instead of free Gmail.


Turn on the 'Hide Ads' setting
---

1. Open `Mailplane > Preferences` and go to `Style` via the toolbar
2. Check `Hide Ads`


Replace ads with contact information
---

Use [Rapportive](http://rapportive.com) to replace the sponsored links with useful social information.

1. Open `Preferences > Accounts > Plug-Ins`
2. Check `Rapportive`
3. Read our [Rapportive 'how-to' article](/howto/entry/use_rapportive_in_mailplane)
