No, Mailplane is _not_ a subscription service. You pay for a Mailplane 4.x license. It's not time limited in any way and there are no recurring fees. All updates within a major version (say from 4.0 to 4.1) are included in the purchase price.

With that said, it is a paid upgrade to move from Mailplane 3 to Mailplane 4. Current Mailplane 3 license holders will be offered an upgrade discount. And if you bought Mailplane 3 in 2018 you'll get the upgrade to Mailplane 4 for free.

Don't hesitate to write [us](mailto:support@mailplaneapp.com) if you have any further questions.
