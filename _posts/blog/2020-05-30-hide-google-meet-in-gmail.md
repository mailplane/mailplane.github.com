A while ago, Gmail got a new section in the sidebar to launch Google Meet. Now there is a user setting to hide it when you don't need it.

Go to "Gmail Settings > Chat and Meet" and select "Hide the Meet section in the main menu". G-Suite admins can also disable Meet for the whole organization by [turning off video calling in the Admin console](https://support.google.com/a/answer/9381403). This will hide that section as well.
