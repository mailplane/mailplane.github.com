	Mailplane 3 Beta provides Retina Display support for Apple's line of Retina MacBook Pros.

<p><strong>Logged Out Behavior</strong><br>
We made a few improvements to get the annoying logged-out behavior under control.</p>

This does have a few side effects which you might be aware of:<br>
1. Mailplane 3 doesn't support Calendar Gadget and Docs Gadget anymore<br>
2. Google Plus is blocked by default. You can unblock it in Preferencesâ€¦ > Accounts > Advanced if you still need Google Plus inside Mailplane. But we recommend to leave it blocked especially if you keep multiple accounts open at a time.
