<p><a href="http://workhacks.com/top-3-gmail-management-apps-for-mac/">Workhacks.com</a> published a nice article about three Gmail apps for the Mac:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We gave Sparrow and Fluent a try, and although we are full believers in a more streamlined work flow and minimalistic approach to managing email, it is going to be hard to convert us from Mailplane. This is mostly due to the lack of integration with some of our favorite Gmail plugins (of which we have many) such as Find Big Mail, Other Inbox, Rapportive, Taskforce, Boomerang and Attachments.me. </p>
