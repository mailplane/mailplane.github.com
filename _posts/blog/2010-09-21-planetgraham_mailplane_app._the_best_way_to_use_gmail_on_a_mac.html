<p><a href="http://www.planetgraham.net/1/post/2010/09/mailplan-app-the-best-way-to-use-gmail-on-a-mac.html">Kerry Graham just published a very favorable Mailplane review:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>But a few  years ago I came across a shareware program called Mailplane that changed everything for me. Mailplane is a small shareware application that gives you all the features of Gmail's web interface via a desktop application. And if you have multiple Gmail accounts, you can manage them all in the same application, without having to sign in and out of your different accounts.</p>
