<p>Mailplane 2.0.1 has just been released, the "Check for Update" menu item will load it. Here's what you'll get:</p>

<h4>Improved: Text Clippings support</h4>

<p>You can now drag selected to your desktop to create text clipping. And you can drag the text clipping to your email composition to insert it. In the old days, Mailplane would treat the text clipping as an attachment file.</p>

<h4>Improved: AppleScript and mailto: link support</h4>

<p><p>The body text was restricted to short text when using mailto: URLs or AppleScript. This restriction has now been removed.</p><p>To support Picasa, the AppleScript dictionary has been streamlined to better mimic Mail.app.</p></p>

<h4>Update Russian translation</h4>

<p>Vladislav improved the Russian translation quite a bit.</p>

<h4>Bug fixes</h4>

<ul>
<li>âŒ˜-Z didn't work anymore</li>
<li>Unread message counter didn't work correctly when used over a slow internet connection.</li>
</ul>
