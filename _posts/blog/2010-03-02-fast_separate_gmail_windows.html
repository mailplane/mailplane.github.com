<p>Great news for Mailplane users: "Separate" Gmail windows got much faster! Try the <em>File > New Separate</em> menu item or <em>shift-click</em> a conversation in the Gmail overview list to see the difference.</p>

<p><a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2010/03/fast-new-windows.html" target="_blank">Here's more info from the official Gmail blog:</a></p>

<blockquote><p>One of the lesser-known features of Gmail is its ability to help with multitasking. Frequently, I find that I need to find an old message while I'm composing an email. When this happens, I click on the "new window" icon to pop my compose area into its own window:</p>

<p>There's only one problem — it's been slow! Today, we're rolling out a change that will fix this (reload your account to make sure you get this change). Now, popping out a window is much, much faster. No more "Loading..." progress bar.
</p>
<p>There are a number of places you can pop up new windows in Gmail.</p>
<ul>
<li>In chat, there's the little upward arrow in the title bar:<br/><img style="float:none;" src="/assets/blog/DC5853E4-A663-4879-9217-190223A82DD1.jpg" alt="DC5853E4-A663-4879-9217-190223A82DD1.jpg" border="0" width="207" height="25" />
</li>


<li>When writing a message, hold the "Shift" key while you click on the Compose Mail, Reply, Reply All or Forward links and you'll get a new window for your new message. (Holding the "Shift" key while typing the keyboard shortcut — in other words typing "C" "R" or "F" — has the same effect.)</li>

<li>When you're reading your mail, hold the "Shift" key while you click on a message to open the conversation in a new window. (Same holds true for the "Shift" key and the "o" or "Enter" shortcuts.)</li>

<li>If you're reading an email and want to save it for later, you can click the "New window" link in the upper-right hand corner of the conversation view:<br/><img style="float:none;" src="/assets/blog/ECD5BDE3-911A-44D0-B7CC-94D29E8EA46E.jpg" alt="ECD5BDE3-911A-44D0-B7CC-94D29E8EA46E.jpg" border="0" width="198" height="80" /></li>
