<p><br /><img class="imageStyle" alt="Romanian language - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia" src="/assets/blog/page5_blog_entry25_1.png" width="367" height="213"/><br />Thanks to <strong>Ovi Pășcui</strong> Mailplane talks Romanian and is now fluent in five languages! <br /><br />After consulting <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanian_language" rel="self">Wikipedia</a> I found some interesting facts about the language. It is spoken in many countries: Romania, Republic of Moldavia, Bulgaria, Canada, USA, Russia, Spain, Ukraine, Israel, Serbia, and Hungary. There are about <strong>24 million</strong> people speaking it as their first language! And 4 million speak it as their secondary language.</p>
