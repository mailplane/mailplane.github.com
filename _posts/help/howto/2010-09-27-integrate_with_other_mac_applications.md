A lists of Mac applications, which integrate with Mailplane.

* [BusyCal](http://busymac.com) is an iCal replacement with full Mailplane support.
* Use Mailplane's clipping plugin to create [OmniFocus](/help/2013/04/14/omnifocus-clippings-plugin.html) tasks linking back to the email conversation.
* The "Share > Email" menu item doesn't work anymore within [iWork](http://www.apple.com/iwork) (Numbers, Pages, Keynote) and MS Office. See [here](/howto/entry/iwork_share_with_email) how to work around it.
* [Things](http://culturedcode.com/things), a very nice GTD client, supports Mailplane out of the box. See [here](/howto/entry/create_a_to-do_entry_in_things_app) how to create new tasks from Mailplane.
* Drag and Drop pictures or albums directly from [iPhoto](http://www.apple.com/ilife/iphoto) to dock icon of Mailplane.
* [GrandTotal](http://www.grandtotal.biz/GrandTotal), an invoicing application for designers, lets you email invoices with Mailplane.
* Use Mailplane Service menu from Finder. Learn more [here](/howto/entry/use_mailplane_service_menu_items).
* Use Mailplane's AppleScript interface to integrate any other application. Learn more [here](/howto/entry/compose_email_using_applescript).
* Use it with Application Launchers like Alfred, LaunchBar, or Quicksilver. Learn more [here](/howto/entry/use_mailplane_with_application_launchers).
* Mailplane's URL drag and drop works great with [Alarmsapp](http://www.alarmsapp.com)
* [Lyn](http://www.lynapp.com), a fast and lightweight image browser, lets you directly email pictures.
