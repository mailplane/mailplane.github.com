It's very easy to create a new to-dos based on email conversations. Most importantly, Things creates a to-do that links back to the Gmail conversation.


## How to configure Things app

1. In Thing app go to *Things > Preferences > Quick Entry*.

2. Uncheck the *Enable shortcut for Quick Entry with Autofill* checkbox and then check it again.<br/>

3. When prompted, download a fresh copy of the Things Helper and run it — it’ll be automatically installed into the right location and the feature will be fully functional again.<br/>

## How it works

1. If Mailplane 3 is open, restart it.

2. In Mailplane 3: open a Gmail conversation.

3. Select some text inside the conversation, it'll be added as Things to-do note:<br/>

4. Press the hotkey for *Quick Entry with Autofill*. As a result you'll get the Things Quick Entry dialog:<br/>

5. Make your changes and press Save to add the to-do. After the dialog closes, the to-do can be found in your Things inbox. Just click the email link and your conversation will magically open inside Mailplane 3.<br/>
