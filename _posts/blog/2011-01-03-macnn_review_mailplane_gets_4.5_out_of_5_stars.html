<p>Ilene Hoffmann (MacNN) has just published an comprehensive review: Mailplane received an excellent 4.5 out of 5 stars!</p>

<blockquote>
You might wonder why anyone would pay for an email client, when you can access Gmail from any browser, but this is a feature-rich program. The features to login to multiple accounts,
new mail notification sounds, access to the Mail Address Book, optimizing photos are just a few of the features I like. <a href="(https://mailplaneapp.com/comparison">A handy list comparing Gmail in a web browser and Mailplane exists on uncomplexâ€™s web site</a> and makes it clear that Mailplane offers more than Gmail in a browser.
