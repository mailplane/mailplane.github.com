Simply [download Mailplane 3](http://update.mailplaneapp.com/mailplane_3.php) and go to **'Mailplane 3 > License...'**. The license dialog will take care of everything else. Below is a detailed guide if you need some help along the way.

## Mailplane 2 is still installed

1. Open Mailplane 3 and choose menu Mailplane 3 > License...
2. Mailplane 3 will automatically detect Mailplane 2.
3. Press '20% Update Discount' if you bought Mailplane 2 before October 1 2012
4. Press 'Upgrade for Free' if you bought Mailplane 2 on or after October 1 2012
