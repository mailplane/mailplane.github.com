<p>Mailplane 2.0.2 is a free maintenance release. Use <b>Mailplane->Check for update</b> to load it or <a href="/download">download it manually.</a></p>

<h3>Tip: Focus problem when replying - keys get interpreted</h3>

<p>Sometimes keys get interpreted (instead of entered) when replying to a message. Here's how you can solve the problem:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open System Preferences</li>
<li>Click "Keyboard &amp; Mouse"</li>
<li>Go to the "Keyboard shortcuts" tab</li>
<li>At the bottom of the window there is a "Full keyboard access" setting: Set it to "All controls"</li>
</ol>

<h3>Changed: Apply/Remove Label Panel(&#x2318;-L)</h3>

<p>Google just rolled out a new feature to apply and remove labels. It is nearly identical to the "Apply/Remove Label" panel. Now &#x2318;-L opens the Google "Label" drop down menu.</p>

<h3>Info: Offline Gmail is coming to Mailplane</h3>

<p>Offline Gmail is coming to Mailplane, it will be available in 2.1. If you can't wait and like to test it: <a  href="http://groups.google.com/group/mailplaneapp">Visit the mailplaneapp Google Group.</a></p>

<h3>Bug fixes</h3>

<ul>
<li>Some users couldn't log in. This version detects the problem and allows you to workaround the problem.</li>
<li>Unresponsive or slow Gmail because of missing "Tweak UI->Custom Stylesheet" file. Mailplane now checks for the CSS file and will disable the custom style sheet if it can't find the file.</li>
<li>Crash when using "Advanced->Close instead of Hide Main Window" preference</li>
<li>Tab order wasn't always correct</li>
<li>Font size problems when copy/pasting text or inserting/deleting lines in "Rich text"</li>
</ul>
