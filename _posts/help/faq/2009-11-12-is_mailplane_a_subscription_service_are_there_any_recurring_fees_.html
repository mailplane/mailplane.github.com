<p>No, Mailplane is <u>not</u> a subscription service. You pay for a license to use Mailplane 2.x - it's not time limited in any way and there are no recurring fees.</p>

<p>You don't have to pay for any 2.x updates, they are all included in the purchase price. That said, Mailplane 3.0 will be a payed upgrade. Registered users will the opportunity to buy a discounted license.</p>
