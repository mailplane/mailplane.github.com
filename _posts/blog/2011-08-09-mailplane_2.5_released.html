<p>Mailplane 2.5 has just been released. It includes two new features and Mac OS X Lion related bug fixes. To install it, either use the "Mailplane > Check for update" menu item or <a href="/download.html">download it here.</a></p>

<p>Many MAC OS X Lion users wanted to use the new "full screen" mode in Mailplane. This version now adds support for it: You can switch using the icon in the title bar or the menu item/keyboard shortcut located in the "Window" menu.</p>

<p>Google added a new lab feature called "Preview Pane". With this version, all keyboard shortcuts, toolbar  and menu items support the mode. </p>
