<p>Yesterday, <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things" target="_blank">Cultured Code</a> released Things 1.2.2. Guess what's in the <a href="http://culturedcode.com/things/wiki/index.php/Release_Notes" target="_blank">release notes:</a></p>

<strong>Quick Entry Autofill now works in Microsoft Word 2008 and Mailplane.</strong>

<p>Great! Now it's super easy to create a new to-dos based on email conversations. Most importantly, Things creates a to-do that links back to the Gmail conversation.</p>

<h3>Here's how it works:</h3>

<p>1. In Mailplane: open a Gmail conversation.</p>

<p>2. Select some text inside the conversation, it'll be added as Things to-do note:</p>

<p>3. Select <em>Mailplane > Services > New To-Do containing selection as note</em> or simply press ⌃⌥⇧⌘0</em>. As a result you'll get the Things <em>Quick Entry</em> dialog:</p>

<p>4. Make your changes and press <em>Save</em> to add the to-do. After the dialog closes, the to-do can be found in your Things inbox. Just click the email link and your conversation will magically open inside Mailplane.</p>
