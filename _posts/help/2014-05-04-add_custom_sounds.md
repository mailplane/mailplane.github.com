In order to choose a custom notification sound in Mailplane 3, you need to add it to your system sounds first.

Open Finder, go to Go > Go to Folder (or press `Cmd-Shift-G`) and enter the following path: `~/Library/Sounds`

Copy and paste your custom sound file into to that folder.

Restart Mailplane 3, go to `Preferences > Accounts > Notification` and choose your newly added custom sound in the `Play Sound` list.
