Mailplane recently had the opportunity to be reviewed by Ronald Schoedel of [iLegalPad](http://ilegalpad.com) and [Alaska User Group](http://akappleug.org). He wrote up wonderful review and it's well worth the read. I have a feeling you may learn a couple Mailplane related tricks from his write up, as he didn't miss a thing!

Ronald even caught up with our newly revamped PDF attachment editing process. He wrote:

"One of Mailplane's cleverest features is the ability to edit attachments you've received (such as PDFs for signature) and then turn around and email the edited version back, with just a few mouse clicks.  This can be a real workflow time saver, freeing you from first saving a file, opening it, editing it, saving it again, locating it on your hard drive, and sending it back.  As with OS X's Mail.app, you can also drag and drop a file icon on the Mailplane app icon in your dock to attach a file to a new message, something that is impossible with the web client."

Much thanks to Ronald for taking the time to write such a great, informative review. You can read the full review [here](http://www.ilegalpad.com/reviews/mailplane-3-impressive-gmail-client-for-os-x).
