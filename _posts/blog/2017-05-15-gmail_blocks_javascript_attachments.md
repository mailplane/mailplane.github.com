.js has been added to the list of file type that are blocked by Gmail for security reason.

You'll find the full list of blocked file types here: [full list](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/6590?hl=en)

Tips:

1) Change the file extension if you still want to send JavaScript.

2) Unfortunately it's not so easy if you receive a JavaScript file from someone else. You need to use a native email client like Apple Mail. Gmail disables the download and the "Save to Drive" button.
