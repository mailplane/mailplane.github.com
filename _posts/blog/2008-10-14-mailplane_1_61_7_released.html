<p>Some users experienced two new bugs, they were caused by some recent Gmail changes:</p>

<ol>
<li>Gmail 007 error</li>
<li>"Could not connect to Gmail" when loading Gmail inbox</li>
</ol>

<p>Please use the "Mailplane->Check for updates" menu item to load the new version, <a href="/download.html">or visit the download page to get it.</a></p>
