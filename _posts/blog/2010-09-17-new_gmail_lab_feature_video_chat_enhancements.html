<p>Found on <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com">the official Gmail blog.</a> If you use Gmail video chat, you may want to check out this new lab feature:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>If you use video chat in Gmail, you might be interested in a new Labs feature we just rolled out that allows you to preview new video chat features before they're turned on for everyone. Visit the Gmail Labs tab under Settings, turn on "Video chat enhancements," and right away, you'll see higher resolution video and a bigger video chat window. </p>

<p><img style="float:none;" src="/assets/blog/videochat_highres.jpg" alt="videochat_highres.jpg" border="0" width="500" height="250" /></p>

<p>The higher resolution video uses a new playback mechanism which enables widescreen VGA and frees up valuable resources on your computer. For it to work, both you and the person you're chatting with will need to have the lab turned on. Remember that you can always revert to standard video chat by disabling the lab.</p>

<p>We plan to add more video chat enhancements to this lab in the future, so if you have it on you'll automatically get those too. Feel free to post your comments or report any issues you encounter in the video chat forum (we also follow #googlevideochat on Twitter).</p>
