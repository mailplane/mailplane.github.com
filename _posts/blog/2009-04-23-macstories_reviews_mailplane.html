<p><a href="http://www.macstories.net/2009/05/01/mailplane-brings-gmail-to-your-mac-desktopmailplane-porta-gmail-sul-vostro-mac/">Ticci at Macstories has just written a nice Mailplane review:</a></p>

<blockquote>
The idea behind Mailplane is to fill the gap between Gmail and desktop, a lack that Google still (strangely) did not remedied.
Mailplane gives you the power to access to all Gmail accounts that you have, quickly switch between them, attach files from your Mac via a simple drag &amp; drop and more, with all the future that Google provides to his service.
Mailplane is a sort of mini-browser, exclusively designed to access Gmail with all the obvious convenience of a desktop application.
