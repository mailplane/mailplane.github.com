Crashes shouldn't happen, and we'll do everything to solve them. They can be caused by a Mailplane bug, a misconfiguration of the Mac, or other software like InputManagers. The crash report is extremely important for fixing the cause of the crash.

Mailplane makes it easy to send use the full crash report: When you restart Mailplane after a crash, you'll be asked to submit the crash report.

Feel free to send us any additional information in the 'Comments' section (e.g. the steps which led to the crash). We'll try our best to respond to every commented crash report.
