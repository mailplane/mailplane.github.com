<p>Yes, you can. Install your Mailplane license on any Mac you use:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Single-user license:</strong> <u>Install on all Macs you personally use.</u> Use it at home, school, work: just anywhere. <u>Limitation:</u> Make sure you're the only user. Please do not share your license with anyone
else.</li>
<li><strong>Family license:</strong> Allow up to five (5) family members <u>living in the same household</u> to use Mailplane on their Macs. As with the single user license, there is no machine limitation for any of the five users.</li>
<li><strong>Site license:</strong> For a number of users working at the same organization. Again, each user may use it anywhere.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> If you need to upgrade your license (say from "single user" to "family"), <a href="https://mailplaneapp.com/store/upgrade/" target="_blank">check out the new upgrade page.</a></p>
