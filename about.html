	<span class="blue">Story</span>
	<p class="main">
		Ruben has started Mailplane in 2006 on the beautiful Island of Corsica. He called it GmailSender because it was just a iPhoto plugin to attach pictures to a Gmail message. From that basis Mailplane grew to a specific browser for Gmail which he released officially at the end of 2007.<br/>
		<br/>
		At the end of 2010 Lars and Ruben partnered to build Mailplane 3. The new version should take the best parts of Mailplane 2 and add abilities like keeping multiple accounts open at the same time, integrate Google Calendar and improve the attachment handling. After having it in beta for more than one year we're ready to share it officially with you. We hope you'll love it as much as we do and continue the success story of Mailplane with us.
