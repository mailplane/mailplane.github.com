A few weeks ago, Apple made macOS High Sierra (10.13) available via their [Beta Software Program](https://beta.apple.com/sp/betaprogram).

If you like, you can download a preview version of Mailplane 3 [here](https://update.mailplaneapp.com/mailplane_3.php?version=3215) which doesn't crash on launch anymore.

Don't hesitate to [let us know](mailto:support@mailplaneapp.com) if you run into further issues with Mailplane 3 on macOS High Sierra.
