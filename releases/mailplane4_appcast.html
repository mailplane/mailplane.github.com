    <strong>Performance Improvements:</strong>
    We improved the typing when composing an email and keyboard shortcut performance.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Open downloads automatically:</strong>
    Mailplane doesn't open Finder anymore after an attachment has been downloaded. You can
    enable 'Open downloads automatically' in 'Preferences > General' to let it open the default app automatically.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Rename attachments prior to downloading: </strong>
    Attachments can now be renamed prior to downloading and file dialog keyboard shortcuts will now work properly.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Open Google Drive in web browser: </strong>
    There's a new setting in 'Preferences > Accounts > Advanced' which allows you to open Google Drive in your default web browser.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Save to Google Drive:</strong>
    Save to Google Drive can now be accessed by holding the Option key while hovering over the attachment.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Context Menu:</strong>
    Added 'Copy Link', 'Copy Email Address', 'Open Link', and 'Download Link' to the context menu.
