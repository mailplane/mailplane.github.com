<p>Over the past two to three weeks, 700 beta users were invited to the beta. But, the waiting list is growing rapidly, and to speed things up, I have decided to send out 100 invitations each day. The waiting list will be processed in chronological order, with the first 100 getting notified today. If you with to join the invitation waiting list, sign up <a href="/download" rel="self" title="Beta Program">here</a>.</p>
