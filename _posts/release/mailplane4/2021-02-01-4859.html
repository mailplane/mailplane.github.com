    <strong>Fixes and Improvements</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Improved password filling functionality.</li>
        <li>Adjusted dark mode style of checkboxes in macOS Big Sur.</li>
        <li>Supports Option-Command arrow keys to switch tabs to the left and right.</li>
        <li>Shows an alert box instead of crashing if saving a clip to the latest version of Evernote. It doesn't provide an AppleScript interface anymore. Use Evernote Legacy if you still needs this functionality.</li>
        <li>Fix: External links in Gmelius (e.g. a link in the board view) replaced the Gmail content in Mailplane.</li>
        <li>Fixed cases where Mailplane content got blurry after changing screen resolutions.</li>
    </ul>
