<p><img class="imageStyle" alt="StatusItemWithMenu" src="/assets/blog/page5_blog_entry14_1.png" width="342" height="343"/><br />Many users missed a status item, now Mailplane provides it: Use it to get notified, open unread messages, compose new message (with or without screenshot), or switch to another Gmail account. Below each account you can see the most recent unread messages. <br /><br />For those who like to preserve menu bar space, there is a "General" preference to turn it off.</p>
