<p><img class="imageStyle" alt="iPhoto-1" src="/assets/blog/page5_blog_entry40_1.png" width="399" height="103"/><br />The old iPhoto plugin was based on the SIMBL InputManager. As InputManagers are not supported in Mac OS X Leopard, a new iPhoto plugin is provided. When the plugin is installed, you can choose Mailplane as your email application in iPhoto/General preferences. The icon in the lower part of iPhoto is then changed to Mailplane, too.<br /><br />See Mailplane help for more info.</p>
