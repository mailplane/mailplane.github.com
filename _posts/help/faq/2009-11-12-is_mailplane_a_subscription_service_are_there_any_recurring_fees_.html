<p>No, Mailplane is <u>not</u> a subscription service. You pay for a license to use Mailplane 2.x or Mailplane 3.x. It's not time limited in any way and there are no recurring fees.  You get al updates included within a major version.</p>

<p>You don't have to pay for any updates within a version. All updates within Mailplane 2 (say from 2.5.11 to 2.5.13) or within Mailplane 3 (Say from 3.0.1 to 3.0.2) are all included in the purchase price. With that said, it is a paid upgrade to move from Mailplane 2 to Mailplane 3.  Current license holders will be offered a discount on the upgrade to Mailplane 3. If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to contact us. support@mailplaneapp.com.com</p>
