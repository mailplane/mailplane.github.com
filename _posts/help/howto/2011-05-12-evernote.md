Remember and track your email conversations with Evernote.

With the Mailplane Evernote integration you can easily create notes linking to a Mailplane conversation and import attachments to Evernote.


## Requirements

To use the Evernote integration, you need to register for a [free Evernote account](http://www.evernote.com/about/referrer/?code=mailplane) and to install their Evernote for Mac application.


## Creating Notes

To create a note, open a conversation in the main window and either click ...

... the 'Evernote' toolbar item (Tip: click the 'View > Customize Toolbar' menu item to add the toolbar item to your toolbar)

... or use the Edit > Save to Evernote menu item

If you select some text, the selected text is copied to the note. If no text is selected, the text of the last message is used as the note text.

Evernote will open right after you create the note:

You can review your note and you have the opportunity to:

* Remove the note using the 'Delete' toolbar item

Follow these steps:

1. Click View > Customize Toolbar menu item
2. Drag the Evernote icon to the toolbar
3. Click the "Done" button.

**Tip**: If you'd like to import a whole photo collection, download the ZIP file. On importing, Mailplane will unpack the ZIP file and create a note containing all pictures.

### Using keyboard shortcuts

By default, the Evernote menu item doesn't have a keyboard shortcut. If you'd like to assign a keyboard shortcut, please [watch this video for instructions](http://mailplaneapp.com/screencasts/entry/change_keyboard_shortcuts/).
