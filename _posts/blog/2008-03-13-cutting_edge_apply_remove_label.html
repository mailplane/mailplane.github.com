<p>Gmail labels are very nice and they work great with filters. However, applying a label manually is cumbersome. Labels are kind of hidden in the "more actions" menu, the user has the use the mouse to do do it.<br /><br />Mailplane now makes applying and removing a label much easier. Everything can be done from the keyboard; no mouse interaction is required.<br /><br />Either press Cmd-L  (or just the "L") key and open the label auto completion. Then narrow down the list by entering a few letters, press the enter key to apply or remove the label.<br /><br/></p>

<h4>Watch screencast to get started:</h4>

<div class="screencast-link">
<a class="screencast-link" href="/screencasts/entry/install_custom_stylesheet"><img style="float:none;" src="/static/images/screencasts_xlarge.png" alt="Screencasts"/></a>
<br/>
<a class="screencast-link" href="/screencasts/entry/apply_remove_gmail_label">Watch Screencast</a>
</div>

<hr class="space"/>

<p><br /><strong>Important: This feature works in Gmail 2 only!</strong></p>
