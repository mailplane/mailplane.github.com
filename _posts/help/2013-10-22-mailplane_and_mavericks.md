We’re really excited about today’s release of OS X Mavericks. It received some nice additional features but most importantly it is much more efficient when it comes to memory and CPU usage. And hey, it's free! Learn more [here](http://www.apple.com/osx).

And yes, Mailplane 3.1.1 is ready for Mavericks. Go to `Mailplane 3 > Check for Updates...` or download it from our [download page](http://mailplaneapp.com/download).

Enjoy!
