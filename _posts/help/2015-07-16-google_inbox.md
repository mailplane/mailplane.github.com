Our customers frequently request to see Google Inbox support within Mailplane. We don't officially support it yet but you can already start using Google Inbox within Mailplane as you would within a browser.

To enable Inbox within Mailplane, open your Inbox account within your preferred browser and go to settings. Enable 'Redirect Gmail to inbox.google.com' and click 'done'. The next time you open your Mailplane account, it will automatically redirect you to Google Inbox.

Previously our customers were experiencing issues with tabs not loading but this is resolved with our newest release. If you are still getting a 'Waiting for ...' message, please ensure you're running the most recent version by clicking 'Mailplane 3 > Check for Updates'.
