<div class="item">
    <ul>
        <li>Mailplane doesn't press the sign-in button automatically anymore. It fixes the sign-in loop where Gmail jumps to an error page that says "something went wrong".</li>
        <li>Hides the Google app and account selector in calendar tab because it became sticky for certain accounts.</li>
    </ul>
</div>
