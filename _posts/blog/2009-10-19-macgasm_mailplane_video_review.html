<p><a href="http://www.macgasm.net/2009/10/14/mailplane-gmail-from-your-desktop/" target="_blank">Corey Harris published a detailed and very useful video review on Macgasm:</a></p>

<blockquote>I don’t know about you, But I have several Gmail accounts. It can be a pain in the rear to sign in and out of my accounts just to check my mail. Mailplane makes it easy though. Mailplane is a desktop application that allows you to setup all your gmail accounts and have full access at any time, without having to log in and out of all your accounts.</blockquote>

<p>Here are a few comments to keep in mind when you watch the video:</p>

<ul><li>Mailplane is fully Snow Leopard compatible – the missing label creating feature isn’t related to Snow Leopard</li>
<li>Label creation from the Command-L dialog: This is a Mailplane 2.1 feature, which is still in beta. Mailplane 2.0.x doesn't have the feature.</li>
<li>Family license: It’s for up to 5 users living in the same household.</li>
<li>Using the “Multiple Inbox” lab feature w/ Mailplane may cause some problems with keyboard shortcuts.</li></ul>
