<p>Thanks to Gmail, handling PDF attachments just got much easier in Mailplane. <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/fast-pdf-viewing-right-in-your-browser.html">From the Gmail blog:</a></p>

<blockquote>When I get sent a PDF, sometimes I just want to view it -- I don't always need to download and save it right then. So starting today, you'll see a new "View" link next to PDF attachments you get in Gmail:

Clicking "View" quickly opens the PDF inside your browser, complete with the graphics and formatting you expect to see in a PDF. You may have seen this feature before, in Google Docs. It's the way that we did uploading and viewing of PDFs online. </blockquote>

<p>Here's a screen shot:</p>
