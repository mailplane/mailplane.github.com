<p>Google is famous for its search, but search in Google Apps documents or Gmail attachments was rather lacking. <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/new-in-labs-find-docs-and-sites-quickly.html" target="_blank">Here's a new lab feature</a> to improve search in Google Apps and Gmail:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Where is that presentation? Was it attached to an email? Or in Google Docs? If you’re not sure, you may end up searching several places with the same query in order to find it. With the new “Apps Search” lab, we just made that all a bit simpler.</p>

<p>Once you enable it from the Gmail Labs tab under Settings, the “Search Mail” button in Gmail will say “Search Mail and Docs” instead, and your search results will include matching documents and sites in addition to email messages.</p><img style="float:none;" src="/assets/blog/Google_Apps_Serach.jpg" alt="Google Apps Search" border="0" width="495" height="277" />

<p>We also added “Did you mean?” style suggestions, for those of us who make mistakes (who doesn’t?):</p>

<p>
You may notice that mail results show up just as fast as before while non-mail results may take a tiny bit longer. That way, if you’re just looking for an email, having this lab enabled won’t slow you down. </p>
