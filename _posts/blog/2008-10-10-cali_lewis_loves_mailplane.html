<p>Cali Lewis is one of the early Mailplane users; she discovered Mailplane in the 1.0 beta days. Back then she even <a href="http://www.geekbrief.tv/gbtv-0233-geekbrieftv">presented Mailplane</a> in one of her famous video podcasts. She is still using Mailplane and just <a href="http://geekbrief.tv/Mailplane">blogged about it:</a></p>

<p>
<blockquote>
I <a href="http://twitter.com/CaliLewis/statuses/943521224">tweeted</a> today about an application I use and love, Mailplane. It’s an application that allows you manage multiple Gmail accounts very effectively. You can see when new emails come into a different account without logging in and out, and you switch between accounts with a double click of your mouse. It uses the Gmail interface, so all your labels and filters stay in tact.

And on Twitter:
<blockquote>
Yeah! I'm finally convincing Neal to use Mailplane! It's a lifesaver for me.
