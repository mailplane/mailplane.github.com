<p>Mailplane 2.0 beta 9 has just been released. Use "Mailplane->Check for update" from the menu or <a href="/download.html">download the latest version from the download page.</a></p>

<h4>New: Online Help Window</h4>

<p>Mailplane now has a brand-new help window. It gives you online access to FAQ, Known Issues, Screencasts, and the new features section. As it is online, the topics are always up-to-date. It works much faster than the previous Help window, and the Mailplane download file got smaller, too.</p>

<p>Use Help->Mailplane Help to open the window.</p>

<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>

<ul>
<li>Problems using the "separate" window due to a Gmail update (no picture drag and drop, no shortcuts, disabled toolbar icons)</li>
<li>French users could not attach pictures by using drag and drop.</li>
<li>Separate window didn't remember size and position.</li>
<li>Spam and Trash didn't show up in the Navigate to Label panel (Cmd-Opt-G).</li>
<li>Mailto: URLs inside Mailplane didn't work correctly, as the subject field wasn't filled. This is a Gmail bug and Mailplane now works around it to fix it.</li>
</ul>
