We hope you are enjoying your summer so far!

In case you hadn't noticed it, we updated the way you can search for help on our [help page](https://mailplaneapp.com/help). Our search box failed to pull up related entries some of the time so we've simplified and now you can see them by category, for easy finding.

If you find anything missing, wish there was a tutorial/guide on how to use a specific function or find yourself using a feature that we may not have highlighted before, let us know!

**Tip**: Did you know that you can see what features have been added to the newest updates? There's a simple way to access that information so you can stay up to date with the features as you update. The easiest way is by clicking on the Mailplane menu, `Help > Release Notes`. You can also [use this link](https://mailplaneapp.com/releases/mailplane3.html) to read all the latest details.
