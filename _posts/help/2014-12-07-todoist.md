[Todoist](http://todoist.com) is a popular to-do list and task manager. With Mailplane you can easily create tasks based on Gmail conversations (it isn't supported in Google Inbox due to technical limitations).

1. Install [Todoist for Mac](https://en.todoist.com/mac)

2. Open a conversation in Mailplane

3. Select some text you’d like to see in the note section of the new task. Mailplane copies the current message if you don’t select a text.

4. Perform `Save to Todoist` from the Edit menu.
