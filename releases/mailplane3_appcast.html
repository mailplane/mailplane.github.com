    <p>Mailplane 3.8.7 fixes attachment download on macOS Catalina and a few more issues. See <a href="https://mailplaneapp.com/releases/mailplane3.html">More...</a></p>
    <p>Please keep in mind that we don't actively develop Mailplane 3 anymore and therefore have no plans for further updates at this time. Give <a href="https://mailplaneapp.com/releases/mailplane4_upgrade_what_is_new.html">Mailplane 4</a> a try if you want to stay current.</p>
