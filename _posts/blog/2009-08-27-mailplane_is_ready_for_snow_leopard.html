<p>Tomorrow is "Snow Leopard" day! Both Mailplane versions (<a href="/download.html">stable</a> and <a href="/download.html">beta</a>) are ready for the new and shiny OS release.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/blog/snow_leopard.png" width="640" height="345" alt="Snow Leopard" /></p>

<p>Mailplane has been tested on the most recent Snow Leopard developer preview version. However, tomorrow's final release may still have a few "surprises" for Maiplane.
In case you get stuck, here are a few troubleshooting tips:</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure you have the very <a href="/download.html">latest Mailplane</a> version. (Important: Mailplane 1.x isn't supported anymore and won't work with Snow Leopard).</li>
<li>If you have Google Gears and you get a blank main screen instead of your inbox, please <a href="http://gears.google.com" target="_blank">upgrade Google Gears</a> or <a href="http://www.google.com/support/gears/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=79848" target="_blank">uninstall Google Gears.</a> <strong>Update (08/29):</strong> So far Google hasn't upgraded Google Gears for Safari - please uninstall Google Gears for now and <a href="http://gears.google.com">watch this page for the version.</a></li>
<li>Maybe an incompatible InputManager is the culprit? To find out: Disable all InputManagers by renaming this folder: /Library/InputManagers. Restart Mailplane to apply the change. When your done testing, rename the folder back to /Library/InputManagers.</li>
<li>To find out if it is a general problem or Mailplane bug, please open <a href=">https://mail.google.com/mail" target="_blank">https://mail.google.com/mail</a> inside Safari (not Firefox).</li>
</ul>
