<p><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="webkit" src="/assets/blog/page5_blog_entry20_1.png" width="128" height="128"/></div>Last week, Apple released Safari 3 beta. This is great news for Mac and now even Windows users. <br /><br />However, for a WebKit based application like Mailplane there are way too many options. Some users still use the old WebKit provided by Mac OS X 10.4 (Tiger). Some have installed and configured WebKit nightly to be used in Mailplane. And now there is the new Safari 3 beta WebKit that causes Mailplane trouble. This leads to unnecessary confusion.<br /><br />I like to provide a running solution out of the box, and I have decided to bundle a tested and preconfigured WebKit nightly with Mailplane. It will work despite your system configuration, or if you have installed Safari 3 beta. "Rich text editing" will be enabled by default and the option to configure the WebKit path will be gone. <br /><br />Meanwhile, there is a workaround if you would like to use Safari 3 and Mailplane on the same system:<br />1. Download WebKit nightly from <a href="http://nightly.webkit.org" rel="self">here</a>.<br />2. Enable <strong>rich text editing</strong> and configure the WebKit path in <strong>Advanced</strong> preferences<br /><img class="imageStyle" alt="Preferences-6" src="/assets/blog/page5_blog_entry20_2.png" width="413" height="201"/><br /></p>
