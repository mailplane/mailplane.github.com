<p>If you are having problems logging in to one account and/or sending/archiving emails from one account, please try clearing out the cookies stored within Mailplane as follows:</p>

<p>1) Close Mailplane
2) In Finder navigate to /Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Mailplane (Option click "GO" menu then click "Library") <em>If you are using Lion, you need to hold the 'option' key while clicking 'GO" to reveal the Library</em>
3) Move all files ending with the word .cookies to the Trash (do not remove any other file!)
4) Start Mailplane</p>

<p>If this does not solve the issue, please contact us for customer support: support@mailplaneapp.com</p>
