Apple released macOS Big Sur (10.16) today.

We tested [Mailplane 4.3](https://mailplaneapp.com/releases/mailplane4.html#4846) with MacOS Big Sur and made corrections to ensure compatibility.

**Update 12/03/2020:** Mailplane 4 runs well on M1-based Macs. Don't hesitate to [let us know](mailto:support@mailplaneapp.com) if you run into any issues.
