	TaskForce plug-in is back in Mailplane 3 and we added RightInbox. RightInbox was kind enough to give Mailplane users a <a href="https://sites.fastspring.com/rightinbox/instant/rightinbox-subscription?coupon=MAILPLANE3" target="_blank">30% discount until May 15th</a>. We urge you to check them out!

	Compose messages with different accounts directly from the Dock. Close the main window (Command-W) and you're able to send email without having to look at email. Thanks to John and <a href="http://www.kungfugrippe.com/post/45763194525/compose-gmail-message" target="_blank">Merlin Mann</a> for the idea!

	Some of you might already know it. "Reset Mailplane" is our secret weapon :) Next to removing Cookies, it does now also clear Caches, close all windows and tabs and restarts Mailplane.

	<img width="100px" class="left" src="/assets/release/mailplane3/2013-04-10-646/lets_move.png"/><strong>LetsMove Integration</strong><br>
	LetsMove is a tiny but very helpful addition. If it's not already in the Application folder, Mailplane ask you now on start-up if it should move itself to the Applications folder.

	<img width="100px" class="left" src="/assets/release/mailplane3/2013-04-10-646/add_cc_recipients_shortcut.png"/><strong>'Add Cc Recipients' Shortcut</strong><br>
	Gmail's new <a href="http://support.google.com/mail/answer/6594?hl=en" target="_blank">'Add Cc recipients' Shortcut</a> happened to conflict with 'Format > Font > Show Colors'. Thus, we changed Show Colors to Command-Option-C. Thanks to Daniel for the idea!
