We're very happy to officially announce Mailplane 3 today. This is a major update to our popular Mac OSX application for Gmail.

It's completely new. After six years in service, it was time to re-think Mailplane. Mailplane 3 is still based on the same core values, but we redesigned and reconsidered it from the ground up.

In addition to the features of Mailplane 2, it supports Gmail's new compose mode, previews attachments in QuickLook, integrates with Mountain Lion's Notification Center and looks gorgeous on Retina screens.

And with [AwayFind](https://www.awayfind.com) and [RightInbox](http://www.rightinbox.com), we have two new plugins on board. Both were kind enough to give Mailplane users a 30% discount until May 15th. Click [here for AwayFind](http://orchant.awayfind.com/admin/upgrade?promo_code=awayplane) and [here for RightInbox](https://sites.fastspring.com/rightinbox/instant/rightinbox-subscription?coupon=MAILPLANE3). We urge you to check them out!

Last but not least, Mailplane 3 integrates Google Calendar and features tabs to switch between accounts in a blink of an eye. Visit our site to learn more.

If you're ready to buy, you can [purchase Mailplane directly from us](http://sites.fastspring.com/uncomplex/product/mailplane3). At the moment, we don't have plans to sell Mailplane via the Mac App Store. [See our FAQ](/faq/entry/can_i_buy_mailplane_in_the_mac_app_store) for more details.

Our previous customers are eligible for a 20% upgrade discount and all customers who bought it on or after October 1 2012 will get the upgrade for free. Simply [download Mailplane 3](http://update.mailplaneapp.com/mailplane_3.php) and go to 'Mailplane 3 > License...'.

Thank you again for your support over the years. We're very grateful to be able to do what we love. And that's only possible thanks to our loyal customer base.

Lars, Ruben &amp; Jessica
