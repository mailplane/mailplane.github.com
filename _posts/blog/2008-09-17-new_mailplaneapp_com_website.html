<p><a href="http://mailplaneapp.com/search/">Search</a> the whole website for new features, screencasts, faq, known issues</p>

<p><a href="/screencasts/">Watch screencasts</a>, they are now grouped by category and can be found in one place. I plan to add more short screencasts before the release of 2.0.</p>

<p><a href="/blog/">Enjoy the brand new blog.</a> Much improved categories, commenting, and archives.</p>

<p><a href="http://mailplaneapp.com/issues/">Check for known issues.</a> The same information is displayed in the "Mailplane->Help->Support Feedback" window.</p>

<p><a href="http://mailplaneapp.com/site/subscribe/">Subscribe</a> the FAQ, blog, known issues, and screencasts.</p>

<p><p>I hope you enjoy the new design and improvements as much as I do. If anything isn't working as it should, either leave a comment or use the new <a href="http://mailplaneapp.com/contact/">contact form</a> to get in touch.</p>
