<p>How to enable/disable Adobe Flash and other Internet Plug-Ins.</p>

</div>
<div>
<p>Gmail relies on Adobe Flash for a couple of features:</p>

<ul>
<li>The advanced attachment uploader </li>
<li>Google voice</li>
</ul>

<p>Unfortunately Adobe Flash, Gmail and the current system WebKit on Mac OS X 10.6.* do not work well. The cursor stops blinking and the plugin can crash Mailplane (or Safari). </p>

<h3>Mailplane downloaded from our website:</h3>

<p>Mailplane includes a custom WebKit to solve the problem. So you can use Flash together with any other Gmail feature. However, if you turn on the <em>Preferences > Advanced > Use System WebKit</em> and you run into problems, please also check the <em>Preferences > Advanced > Disable Flash Plugin</em> setting.</p>

<h3>Mailplane bought in the Mac App Store:</h3>

<p>This is why Mailplane is bundled with a custom WebKit, which solves the problem. The Mailplane Mac App Store version disables all internet plugins to solve the problem.</p>

<p>Here's how you can enable internet plugins to use Google voice and video chat:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open <em>Preferences > Advanced</em></li>
<li>Enable 'Load internet Plugins'</li>
<li>Go to <em>Gmail > Settings > General</em> and set "Aattachments" to "Basic attachment features"</li>
<li>Restart Mailplane</li>
</ol>
