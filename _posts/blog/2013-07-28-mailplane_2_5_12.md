Google introduced a [new compose mode](http://gmailblog.blogspot.ch/2012/10/introducing-new-compose-in-gmail.html) in Gmail at the end of last year. Mailplane 3 supported it from the beginning but Mailplane 2 required you to revert back to the old compose mode. We promised to not let Mailplane 2 'die' if Google drops the old compose mode permanently.

We don't make many promises, but we do we try our best to keep up with them. Our latest Mailplane update 2.5.12 does now support it. It isn't up to the same level as in Mailplane 3 but you don't need to worry anymore losing Mailplane if Google drops the old compose mode.

You can get it via `Mailplane > Check for Updates...` or our [download page](/download).

Thanks for your patience!
