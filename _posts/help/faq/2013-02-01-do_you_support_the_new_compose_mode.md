[Mailplane 3](/index.html) does already support it but [Mailplane 2](/download) still requires you to revert to the old compose window (see screenshot below) to ensure Mailplane is running bug free.

Please know that we will not let Mailplane 2 'die' if Google drops the old compose permanently.  We we try our very best to find a solution, though we cannot guarantee that it will run without some restrictions.
