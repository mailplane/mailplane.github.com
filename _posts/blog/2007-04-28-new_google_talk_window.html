<p><img class="imageStyle" alt="GoogleTalk" src="/assets/blog/page5_blog_entry11_1.png" width="461" height="147"/><br />Since last update, Mailplane includes a Google Talk window for an easy chat. Never miss a call again: If somebody wants to talk, Mailplane shows a Growl notification. The brand-new Google Talk Gadget (displayed inside the window) offers some nice features like video and photo preview. See the this <a href="http://googletalk.blogspot.com/2007/03/google-talk-gadget.html" rel="self">blog</a> for more information. <br /><br />Currently the Google Talk window works with "normal" Google accounts. Support for "Google Apps for your Domain" accounts will be added as soon as the Gadget is ready for it.<br /></p>
