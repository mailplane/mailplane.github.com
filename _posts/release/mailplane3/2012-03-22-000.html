<p>This is an intermediate update to extend the beta license by another month. It doesn't contain many new features because we're still working on a more stable and less resource-hungry version of Mailplane 3.0 by using WebKit differently. Stay tuned!</p>

	We moved the account settings to the Preferences dialog (Mailplane/Preferences...). Many users have had problems finding them and it gives us more flexibility for further enhancements down the road.

	* Send/Save/Discard does map correctly again (e.g. keyboard shortcuts)<br>
