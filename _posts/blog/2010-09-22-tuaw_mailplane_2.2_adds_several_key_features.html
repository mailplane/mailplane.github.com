<p><a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2010/09/22/mailplane-2-2-adds-several-key-features">TJ Luoma just published an excellent post on TUAW.</a> It is a comprehensive account of the Mailplane 2.2 features. </p>

<p>Here is his favorite feature:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>My favorite new feature is the ability to drag a Mailplane URL directly from the title bar. I use this with <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/tag/BusyCal">BusyCal's</a> URL field if I need to connect an email with a meeting. It works for conversations or searches.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the conclusion:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Version 2.2 is a pretty significant update despite its minor numerical increment.</strong></p>

<p>Naturally, you can always use Gmail in a browser for free rather than spending money on an app like Mailplane. But I've used Mailplane since it was in beta, and I would never go back. It is very actively developed, with new features regularly being added. Having a real Mac app for a mail client is well worth the money for anyone who spends a lot of time in email. If you manage multiple Gmail or Google Apps email accounts, the easy switching alone makes it worth the asking price.</p>
