Why?<br /><br />Many people access their Gmail mailbox from various locations and devices. In my case this is<br /><ul class="disc"><li>Mailplane on my MacBook and the family iMac</li><li>the <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/topic.py?topic=1580" rel="self">Gmail java application</a> on my Motorola V3 handset</li><li>Firefox on a linux box</li><li>And occasionally Internet Explorer on Windows</li></ul><br />IMAP now extends access to my precious email data:<br /><ul class="disc"><li>As the iPhone doesn't run the java application to access Gmail, I will be able to use IMAP when I will </li><li>I will be able to backup my Gmail email data</li></ul><br />Regardless how I access my Gmail mailbox, I see and change the <strong>same</strong> email data. For example, I could "star" a conversation on my handset, then create a reply on Linux with Firefox, attach a photo with Mailplane, and then send the draft from an iPhone.<br /><br />Will IMAP access replace Mailplane for me? No way!<br />I love the Gmail web interface, in my opinion it beats all traditional mail clients. For me Gmail thru Mail.app isn't Gmail anymore: no real labels, no Google search, no pretty conversation view. And Mailplane gives me best of both worlds: The speed and power of Gmail and the beauty and functionality of my Mac desktop.</p>
