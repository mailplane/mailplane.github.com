<p><a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/04/new-in-labs-google-search-right-in.html">There's a new Gmail lab feature. It enables you to "google" inside Mailplane and solves this problem:</a></p>

<blockquote>
I used to have a problem. People would ask me questions, over chat or email, and I'd have to leave Gmail to search Google for an answer. Then I'd have to select the answer, copy it, go back to Gmail and paste the answer into the chat window or my reply. Sometimes I'd get distracted and forget to go back to Gmail, and I'd have to go through it all again when I remembered what I'd been doing.

<p>Once you're sure it's a result you need, moving your mouse over the result back in Gmail reveals a pull-down menu that lets you do stuff with the search result.
What's in the menu depends on what you're doing in Gmail:
</p>

<ul>
<li>If you're reading a message, you can start a reply to the message with the search result as the first thing in your reply.</li>
<li>If you're writing a message, you can paste the result, or just the URL into your message.</li>
<li>If you're chatting with someone, you can send the result via chat.</li>
<li>You can also always compose a new message to send the search result.</li>
</ul>
