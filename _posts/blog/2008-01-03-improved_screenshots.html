<p>The screenshot feature has been much improved and now works in Leopard, too. (This has been released a while ago, but I feel it is worth mentioning).<br /><br /><img class="imageStyle" alt="NewScreenshotFeature" src="/assets/blog/page5_blog_entry47_1.png" width="524" height="287"/><br /><br />You are now able to capture a selection, a window, or the whole screen. By default Mailplane hides itself while the screenshot is captured. <br /><br />This is great way to better explain a problem, feature, or something on your screen. A picture is worth a 1000 words, right?<br /></p>
