<blockquote>When we published the <a href="http://www.google.com/mail/help/tips.html">Gmail tips guide</a> in July, we promised it would help you become a Gmail ninja. Now, if you want to become a Gmail ниндзя or 忍者, you can do that too: these tips are now available in <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/intl/es/tips.html">Spanish</a>, <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/intl/fr/tips.html">French</a>, <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/intl/pt-BR/tips.html">Brazilian Portuguese</a>, <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/intl/ja/tips.html">Japanese</a>, <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/intl/ru/tips.html">Russian</a>, and <a href="http://mail.google.com/mail/help/intl/en-GB/tips.html">UK English</a>.<br /><br />We've also added a handful of new tips to the English site, culled from suggestions you submitted. Some of the new tricks to help manage your email efficiently include <a href="http://www.google.com/mail/help/tips.html#black">sending and receiving mail from multiple addresses</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/mail/help/tips.html#master">adding formatting to chat messages</a>, and <a href="http://www.google.com/mail/help/tips.html#master">selecting multiple messages at once</a> using shift-select. Thanks to everyone who submitted ideas, and please <a href="https://spreadsheets.google.com/viewform?formkey=cmIyZ08xLXhTeWQ2eWhFX3FMeFdnSVE6MA">keep them coming</a>.</blockquote>
