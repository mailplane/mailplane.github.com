We received yet another fabulous review from Apple Insider for their Apps for your Mac; Best Email Clients article.

The article highlights Mailplane's "easy-to-understand user interface" and raves about the ability to switch between multiple accounts easily. They also mention how easy it is to set up accounts, even those using two factor authentication. We try to keep things simple, so we appreciate the comments!
