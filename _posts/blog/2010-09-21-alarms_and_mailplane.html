<p><a href="http://www.alarmsapp.com">Alarms is an extremely handy application</a> I use everyday. It was the main reason why the "Drag Mailplane URL from the title bar" feature was implemented. </p>

<p>Well, what is Alarms anyway? Alarms "sits" in the menu bar and alerts about scheduled events. When an event is due it'll display a <a href="http://growl.info">Growl</a> notification, flashes its icon, and plays a sound.</p>

<p>The coolest part is how Alarms lets me create an event. I just drag a document, a Safari URL, or in most cases a "Mailplane URL" to the title bar.</p>

<p>Alarms slides the screen down to reveal a calendar (it reminds me of TimeMachine) and allows to drop the URL on the day or hour to schedule it.</p>

<p>When the event is due, I click the "eye" icon to open the URL and work on it. Mailplane will then open the linked conversation and I've all required information to complete the task. When I am done, I just check the mark and the task disappears.</p>
