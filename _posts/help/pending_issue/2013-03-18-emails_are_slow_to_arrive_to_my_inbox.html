<p>Sometimes some users are finding that they will get a notification of a new message and it takes awhile to show up in the inbox.  You can access the message quickly by clicking the notification directly, or clicking View > Reload Page (this should  help speed up a slow message).</p>

<p>We are aware of this issue and working hard to get our syncing time better. If you have any questions or comments, please don't hesitate to contact us directly at: support@mailplaneapp.com.com</p>
