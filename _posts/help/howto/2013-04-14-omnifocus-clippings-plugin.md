[OmniFocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) is a great "Getting Things Done" tool. With Mailplane's "Clippings" Plugin you can create tasks based on Gmail conversations or searches. The plugin creates tasks that contains a link to the conversation or search.

## Installation

1. Launch Mailplane 3
2. Go to `Mailplane 3 > About Mailplane` and verify if you have 3.1.3 or higher. If not, update via `Mailplane 3 > Check for Updates...`
3. Restart OmniFocus
4. Go to `OmniFocus > Preferences...` and go to the Clippings tab. Mailplane 3 should be selected.
