<p><br>
I thought I'd finally 'drop in' and officially say "Hello" to all our fantastic Mailplane customers!  I've spoken to many of you via our customer support and it's been a lot of fun learning new things and occasionally, teaching you new things!   ;-) <BR>
<br>
My name is Jessica and I've been Mailplane's customer support gal for a year now.  I'm actually out in Chilly Northern Canada, while the masterminds behind Mailplane originate up in Switzerland!  We're quite world wide!!<BR>
<BR>
Things have been pretty exciting learning Mailplane 2, dealing with all of the challenges that Apple's most recent OS X Mountain Lion brought along and now preparing for the big release of Mailplane 3!  I have really enjoyed getting to know some of you as well as I feel I have, and I truly appreciate the kindness of our customers.  I think we've lucked out!<BR>
<BR>
If anyone ever has any issues, no matter how small, I'd much rather you send me a quick email than sit frustrated with Mailplane!  So please don't hesitate in <span id='eeEncEmail_t1r6G63O6o'>.(JavaScript must be enabled to view this email address)</span><script type="text/javascript">
