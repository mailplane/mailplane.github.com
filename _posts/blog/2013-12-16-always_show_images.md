Gmail is now handling inline images a little differently. Instead of being asked if you want to display the images within a message (which can sometimes contain malware from unknown senders), Gmail will now handle the images on their own secure proxy servers.

This means that images will be checked for known viruses and malware and you will never be asked if you want to "display images" again. Unless you want to, of course. Users can choose the option "Ask before displaying external images" under the General tab in Settings. 

So you will see more of this:

And less of this:
