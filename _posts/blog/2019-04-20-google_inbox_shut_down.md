Google discontinued "Inbox by Gmail" on April 2. We had to say our farewells too and removed support for Google Inbox in [Mailplane 4.1.3](/releases/mailplane4.html#4728).

Google launched Inbox by Gmail back in 2014. It was meant to increase productivity, especially for those who had to deal with a lot of emails. It allowed to create bundles, generate replies, and more.

Over the past few months, Google has been bringing some of the Inbox by Gmail features to regular Gmail. It's sad to see Google Inbox go but we hope that it helps Google to put more focus on Gmail.
