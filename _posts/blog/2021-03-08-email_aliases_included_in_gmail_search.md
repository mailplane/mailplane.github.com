When you search for an email address in Gmail, aliases of the searched address will now be considered as well.

That's pretty neat! For example searching for hello@mailplaneapp.com will now also show emails from support@mailplaneapp.com and vice versa. If you want to retrieve results for that email address only, you can put it in quotes.
