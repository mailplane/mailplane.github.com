<p>Very good news for Italy: Mailplane now speaks Italian, too! Monica Cainarca did the job and she did it wonderfully. The translation is now available with the current stable release (1.61). <br /><img class="imageStyle" alt="Italian" src="/assets/blog/page5_blog_entry55_1.png" width="531" height="300"/><br />BTW: In case you have any English/Italian (or Italian/English) translation need, please check out Monica's <a href="http://www.mctranslation.com" rel="self">McTranslation page.</a> Not only does she general translations, but she knows how to do Mac software translations, too. It is a pleasure to work with her - I highly recommended her services.</p>
