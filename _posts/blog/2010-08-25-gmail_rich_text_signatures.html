<p>This is old news as I am currently catching up with the <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Gmail blog.</a></p>

<p><a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2010/07/rich-text-signatures.html" target="_blank">Gmail now offers Rich text signatures, too.</a> They are very easy to setup and support different from addresses:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The next time you log in and visit the Settings page, you'll see a rich text editor in the signature section. Here, you can customize your signature by adding pretty formatting, links, and images â€” or decide to leave things nice and simple.</p>

<p>Gmail also now supports a unique signature for each email address associated with your account. So, if you send mail using a custom "From:" address, you can use a different signature for that address. From the Settings page, you can edit the signature for each account by changing the email address that appears in the dropdown menu.</p>

<p>You can continue to use Mailplane's rich text signatures. Here are the differences:</p>

<ul>
<li>In Mailplane you can use HTML to define your signature. This gives you more freedom, but it is more involved as you need to know HTML.</p>
<li>Mailplane signatures work in Mailplane only. The Gmail signatures work in all desktop browsers.</li>
<li>You can define more Mailplane signatures and <a href="http://mailplaneapp.com/howto/entry/insert_a_different_signature/" target="_blank">easily replace a signature with a keystroke.</a></li>
</ul>
