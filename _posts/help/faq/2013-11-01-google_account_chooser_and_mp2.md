Google is rolling out a new [Account Chooser for Gmail](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1691641?hl=en&topic=14129). Mailplane 3 is doing fine but we're working on an update for Mailplane 2. It needs a bit help from you in the meantime.


I'm stuck in a log-in loop

The way Mailplane 2 supported [two-step verification](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/180744?hl=en) doesn't work anymore. We'll try to find a solution but for the moment you need to [turn it off](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1064203?hl=en) or if you like and use Lion or higher (10.7+), you can give [Mailplane 3](/download) a try.


I see a landing page

Google shows a landing page the first time before you get to the login screen. Simply press the command key while clicking the top right 'Sign in' link.
