<p>Mailplane 2.5.x currently does not support Gmail's new inline compose window.  You will have to revert to the old compose window (See screen shot below) to ensure Mailplane is running bug free.

<p>If you would like to use the new compose window and are running Lion (10.7) or Mountain Lion (10.8), please use Mailplane 3 <a href="URL">http://beta.mailplaneapp.com</a> <br></p>
