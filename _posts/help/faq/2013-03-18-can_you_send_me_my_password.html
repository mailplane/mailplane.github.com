<p>If you misplace your Mailplane password, we are not able to resend it to you as we do not store any of that information locally.</p>

<p>If you selected to save your password in your keychain, you should be able to access your keychain and search for the Mailplane entry. If you do not have it saved there, you will have to do password recovery through Gmail. If you do have to create a new password, please ensure you update your password within the Mailplane Preferences to continue to have access to your account.</p>
