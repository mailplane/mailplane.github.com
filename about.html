	<span class="blue">Story</span>
	<p class="main">
		Ruben has started Mailplane in 2006 on the beautiful Island of Corsica. He called it GmailSender initially because it was just a iPhoto plugin which attached pictures to a Gmail message. From that basis Mailplane grew to a site specific browser for Gmail which was officially released at the end of 2007.<br/>
		<br/>
		At the end of 2010 Lars and Ruben partnered to build Mailplane 3. The mission was to add better account support, integrate Google Calendar and modernize the appearance. As it happens sometimes, we ended up with a complete rewrite at the end of 2011. This was the basis we went into an extensive beta period which endured until April 2013.<br/>
		<br/>
		We hope you'll love Mailplane as much as we do and continue the success story of Mailplane with us.
