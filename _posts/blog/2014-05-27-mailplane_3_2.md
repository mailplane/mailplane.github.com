Frustrated when you want to annotate a simple document you've received via Gmail? Us too!

You know the steps; Download the document, decide where to store it, open it with your favorite Mac app, go back to the email client, compose a reply, find the document again, attach it and finally send. What a waste of time!

Now it's much easier with Mailplane 3.2. Right click to open the context menu, choose 'Edit', edit it as needed and then 'Attach'. That's it, you're done!
