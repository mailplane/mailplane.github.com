<p>Victor Agreda, Jr just published a <a href="http://www.tuaw.com/2009/10/08/mac-power-tools-workflow-productivity/" target="_blank">very interesting blog post</a> about his favorite Mac power tools. Mailplane is among them!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Next I needed a better way to juggle 3 Gmail accounts. But I also needed a way to track the metric ton of inbox items that flow through those email conduits. The solution was the combination of MailPlane and Things. I had really dedicated my heart to Toodledo, but there's one trick I couldn't replicate on any setup (The Hit List included): when I get an email in MailPlane, I can select some text and press Shift-Ctrl-Opt-Cmd-0 and the Things HUD pops up and autofills the notes section with a link to the email itself. It is awesome.</p>
