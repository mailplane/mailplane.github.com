Apple released macOS Big Sur (10.16) today.

We tested [Mailplane 4.3](https://mailplaneapp.com/releases/mailplane4.html#4846) with MacOS Big Sur and made corrections to ensure compatibility. Read more [here](/help/apple_silicon_compatibility.html).

**Update 11/20/2020:** We learned today that Mailplane 4 runs well on M1-based Macs. We haven't been able to test it ourselves yet because we're still waiting for our MacMini to arrive, but we're optimistic.
