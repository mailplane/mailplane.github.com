<p class="item">
	<strong>Multiple Account Stability</strong><br/>
	We noticed a decline in multiple account stability in the last two months and decided to move away from <a href="https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1721977?hl=en" target="_blank">Google's multiple sign-in</a> functionality.<br/>
	<br/>
	We now keep the sign-ins separate in Mailplane which does also remove Google's previous limitations. We still suggest using our '<a href="http://mailplaneapp.com/howto/entry/switch_to_account" target="_blank">Switch to Account...</a>' functionality if you have a lot of accounts to manage but technically speaking, your Mac's memory and screen estate is the only limit.
