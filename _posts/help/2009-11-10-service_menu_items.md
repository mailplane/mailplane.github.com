Access Mailplane's service menu items from any application to send messages or search your inbox.

Every application has a "Services" menu item to access services provided by other applications. Most services operate on the current selection.

For example, you could select some text in the Pages application and perform the `Pages > Services > Mailplane: Send Selection` service menu item to compose a new message. The selected text will then automatically be inserted into the message body.

These are the the service menu items provided by Mailplane:

`Mailplane: Search Inbox`: Perform a Gmail search using the current text selection. The search result will be displayed inside the Mailplane main window.

`Mailplane: Send Selection`: Compose a new message. The selected text is automatically used as the body text.

`Mailplane: Send To`: Compose a new message and insert the selected text as the TO email address.

`Mailplane: Send File`: Select one or more files in Finder. The service will then compose a new message and attach the files to it.

**Tip:** Enable the service menu items in `App Name > Services > Service preferences.` You can also assign keyboard shortcuts, if you wish.
