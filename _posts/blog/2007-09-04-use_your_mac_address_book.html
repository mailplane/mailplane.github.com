<p>Insert email addresses directly from your Mac address book into your TO, CC, BCC, or message field. It works much like the text snippets panel: Press Cmd-Option-A to open the panel, search for one or more addresses. Press Enter to close the panel and insert the addresses at the focused field. Works with address groups, too. You'll find the panel in the <em>Mail->Insert</em> sub menu.<br /><img class="imageStyle" alt="AddressBookPanel" src="/assets/blog/page5_blog_entry32_1.png" width="486" height="434"/><br /></p>
