Apple released OS X Yosemite today!

It's another a huge leap forward for the Mac. Especially the integration between Mac an iOS. Learn more [here](http://www.apple.com/osx).

We've been running Mailplane 3 for a few months on Yosemite and it works great. Make sure you're on the latest version by going to `Mailplane 3 > Check for Updates...` or downloading it [here](http://update.mailplaneapp.com/mailplane_3.php).

Enjoy!
