[OmniFocus](http://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) is a great "Getting Things Done" tool. With Mailplane's "Clippings" Plugin you can create tasks based on Gmail conversations or searches. The plugin creates tasks that contains a link to the conversation or search.

## Installation

1. Download the Clippings Plugin ([Mailplane 3](/assets/howto/2013-04-14-omnifocus-clippings-plugin/Mailplane3ClippingHandler.plugin.zip) | [Mailplane 2](/assets/howto/2013-04-14-omnifocus-clippings-plugin/MailplaneClippingHandler.plugin.zip)) and extract it
2. Open Finder and goto /Users/__your_name__/Library/Application Support/OmniFocus
3. Create a folder named Plug-Ins (if not already available)
4. Move the plugin to the Plug-Ins folder
5. Restart OmniFocus
6. Open preferences and go to the Clippings tab. Mailplane3 should be selected inside the list.
