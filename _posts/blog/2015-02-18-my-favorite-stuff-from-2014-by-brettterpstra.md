Mailplane got a nice little shout out on brettterpstra.com in his article called ["My favorite stuff of 2014"](http://brettterpstra.com/2015/01/05/my-favorite-apps-of-2014-part-1).

The quote says: "Mailplane 3 is the only other app I’ve used recently, and it’s an excellent interface directly to Gmail when you want to use more Gmail-style searches."

We also enjoyed reading in that article, the nice words to the Smile team who are behind the wonderful PDFPen app, which integrates so nicely with Mailplane. Read more about our [PDFPen integration here](/help/edit_attachments.html).
