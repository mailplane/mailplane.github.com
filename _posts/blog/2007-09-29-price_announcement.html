<p>The beta started in March. This was such an intense and exciting half year. Thank you for all ideas, bug reports, and support!<br /><br />I feel that the time has come to prepare Mailplane for public availability and to announce the price for it:<br /><ul class="disc"><li>A Mailplane <strong>single user license </strong>is<strong> $24.95</strong> and includes free 1.x updates. </li><li>There is a <strong>family option</strong> available (<strong>$8</strong>), which allows you to use Mailplane in your private household on up to five Macs.</li><li>The <strong>evaluation</strong> period will last <strong>30 days. </strong><br /></li></ul><br />For a short time, Mailplane will remain in beta stage. There is still no time limit: the evaluation period will begin when the beta ends. <br /><br /><strong>Special offer for beta users: Buy a single user license today and get the family option for free.</strong> (Offer expires when Mailplane goes public).<br /><br />To go to the store, open "Mailplane->Registration..." and press the "buy now..." button.<br /><br />If you're not a beta user and like to try Mailplane you are welcome to register for the beta <a href="/download.html" rel="self" title="Download Beta">here</a>.</p>
