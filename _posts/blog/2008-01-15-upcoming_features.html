<p>I just added the new <a href="http://mailplaneapp.com/features/2_0/" rel="self" title="Upcoming features">"upcoming features" page.</a> It lists all changes and new stuff that is <strong>already available</strong> in the latest <em>cutting edge</em><strong> </strong>release:<br /><ul class="disc"><li>Gmail 2 support</li><li>Mailplane URLs</li><li>Background account notifications</li><li>Account nickname and re-ordering</li><li>and much more...</li></ul><br /><img class="imageStyle" alt="Preferences-2" src="/assets/blog/new_mail_notification_prefs.png" width="477" height="227"/><br />(General preferences)<br /><br />What is the <em>cutting edge</em> release anyway? It's the upcoming Mailplane version, it's where the new features are added, tried and tested. But, as much is added or changed it may be less reliable than the current stable release. <br /><br />If you like to try it anyway: instructions can be found in the extended and improved <a href="/faq/" rel="self" title="FAQ">FAQ</a> section.</p>
