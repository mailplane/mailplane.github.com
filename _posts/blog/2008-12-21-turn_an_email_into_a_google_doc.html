<p>Google just published a new and very useful lab feature: <a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2008/12/new-in-labs-turn-email-into-google-doc.html">Turn an email conversation into a Google doc:</a>
</p>

<blockquote>
More than once, I've had a conversation over email and later realized that the information contained in the messages would make a great starting point for a document. So I built an experimental feature for Gmail Labs that does just that: with one simple click, "Create a document" converts an email into a Google Docs document.

No more copying and pasting the text from your email -- just open the message you wish to convert, click the "Create a document" link on the right side of the page, and voila, you have a brand new document which you can then modify and share!

<p>There is even a keyboard shortcut for this new feature: <strong>g + w</strong></p>
