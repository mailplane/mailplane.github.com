<p>This update allows Mailplane 2 to start on Yosemite (OS X 10.10) but we cannot offer any insight as to how long this update will last as it depends on Gmail and OS X changes.</p>

<p>So you may eventually notice that some features stop working. We hope you understand that we can't support Mailplane 2 indefinitely. See also our article <a href="https://mailplaneapp.com/help/2013/04/29/what_happens_to_mailplane_2.html">here</a> and don't hesitate to <a href="mailto:support@mailplaneapp.com">let us know</a> if you have any questions.</p>
