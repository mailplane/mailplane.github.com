Mailplane will show you the '!' alert if an account that has notifications enabled is not properly authenticated. Simply click the notifier or right-click the dock and choose the 'Sign&nbsp;in...' menu item thereafter.

In Mailplane 3.5.3, we always require you to authenticate explicitly (instead of falling back to the account password) in order to get rid of the 'sign-in attempt blocked' emails that some customers were receiving from Google.
