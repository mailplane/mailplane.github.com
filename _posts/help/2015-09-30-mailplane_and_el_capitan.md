Apple releases OS X El Capitan today. You can read a bit about the new features [here](https://www.apple.com/osx).

We've been running Mailplane 3 for a few weeks on El Capitan and it works great. Make sure you're on the latest version by going to `Mailplane 3 > Check for Updates...` or downloading it [here](http://update.mailplaneapp.com/mailplane_3.php).

Enjoy!
