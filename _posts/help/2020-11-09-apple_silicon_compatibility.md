We learned today that Mailplane 4 runs well on M1-based Macs. We haven't been able to test it ourselves yet because we're still waiting for our MacMini, but we're optimistic. Stay tuned.

Unfortunately we have not yet been able to make Mailplane 4 fully compatible with Apple Silicon based Macs, but we are working on it.

Don't hesitate to write us to [support@mailplaneapp.com](mailto:support@mailplaneapp.com) if you're interested in a preview version.
