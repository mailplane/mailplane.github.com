With the exception of Google and Plug-in (e.g. Rapportive, Boomerang, etc.) Mailplane opens links externally in your default browser. You can override the default by either holding the `Command` key (= force internally) or the `Command and Shift` key (= force externally) while clicking the link.

Here are the steps:

1. Click a link (e.g. Evernote Market link)

2. It will open the page in your default browser (Chrome, Safari or Firefox).

3. Hold `Command` (internally) or `Command-Shift` (externally) if you want to override the default behavior.
