A little post about some features that perhaps you are not aware of.

**Reset Mailplane**: Did you know that clicking Mailplane > Reset Mailplane can help cure a lot of smaller hiccups? It's a magical little feature that does not cause any change on the forefront of your Mailplane account, but can help re-sync Mailplane to Gmail and correct any off behaviour.

**See the URL if you mouse over a hyperlink**: You get a pop up similar to the browser experience, if you've got View > Show Status Bar enabled.

**Trackpad Gestures**: Use the two-finger slide gesture to go back or forward in the browsing history.

**Do you send a lot of emails to yourself?** We have a Hotkey feature to do so easily. Go to Preferences > Shortcuts to set up "Compose Note to Self".

**Close the main window**: You can close the main window with File > Close Window (or Command-W) and bring it back with Window > Main Window (or Command-0). Closing helps to save resources, get your inbox out of sight but itâ€™s still quick to bring it back again.

**Custom Sounds**: Would you like to add custom sounds into Mailplane? Read our tutorial [here](/howto/entry/add_custom_sounds).

**Gentle Reminders**: Instead of the reminder interrupting your workflow, Gentle Reminders will blink in the background or you can choose a sound notification. Read our tutorial [here](/help/gentle_reminders.html)

Happy Holidays!
