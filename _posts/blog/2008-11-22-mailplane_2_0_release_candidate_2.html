<h4>New: Gmail Video Chat</h4>

<p>This release supports the brand new Gmail Video Chat feature. To get it working: <a href="http://mail.google.com/videochat">download and install the Gmail Video Chat plugin.</a> Gmail Video Chat is only available for Intel Macs.</p>

<p><strong>To support "Gmail Video Chat", Mailplane now works with your system's WebKit only. Make sure you have Safari 3.2 installed. Mac OS X Tiger users: Please upgrade to 10.4.11.</strong> </p>

<h4>Improved: "Attach File" button</h4>

<p>When you directly attach a file using the "Attach File" Gmail button, the attachment is optimized as when you drag and drop the file.</p>

<h4>Improved: Growl notifications</h4>

<p><img src="http://mailplaneapp.com/files/blog/rc2growl.png" width="319" height="172" alt="Improved Growl Notifications" /></p>

<p>Growl title shows "Sender: Subject" and if available a picture fetched from the local address book.</p>

<h4>Changed: Sign out</h4>

<p>Because many users complained about the new sign out feature: Mailplane now either terminates (only one account) or opens the account drawer (more than account). This is how it worked before "release candidate 1".</p>

<p>Tip: âŒ˜-click does the Gmail sign out. </p>

<h4>Info: Gmail Themes</h4>

<p>Gmail now supports different themes, check out your Google settings. <a href="http://mailplaneapp.com/blog">More info</a></p>

<h4>Bug fixes:</h4>

<ul>
<li>Login didn't work for some Google Apps users with single sign on</li>
<li>Spam counter didn't hide for Google Apps users with disabled chat</li>
<li>When starting in "hidden" mode, Mailplane didn't check for new messages as it didn't authenticate the active account</li>
<li>Separate compose window now shows correct title (to/subject).</li>
<li>Long Unicode download file names were truncated </li></ul>
