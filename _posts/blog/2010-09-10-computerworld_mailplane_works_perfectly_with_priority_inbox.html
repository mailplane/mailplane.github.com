<p>Mitch Wagner, author of the <a href="http://blogs.computerworld.com/wagner">Tool Talk Blog</a> on Computerworld, just published a great post about Gmail's new "Priority Inbox" feature: <a href="http://blogs.computerworld.com/16923/gmail_priority_inbox">Gmail Priority Inbox, 10 days later</a>. </p>

<p>And here's what he wrote about Mailplane:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Similarly, Priority Inbox breaks new mail notifications on desktop mail as well. Fortunately, for Mac users, there's a workaround: Mailplane is a great $24.95 Gmail client for the desktop, I've been using it for a long time. The developers are working on a <a href="http://mailplaneapp.com/download/preview">new version</a>, still in beta, which allows you to customize desktop notifications to only show new Priority Inbox messages, or new messages with any user-configurable label. I've been using a it all week, it works perfectly.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you like to try the brand new "Priority Inbox" in Mailplane, <a href="http://mailplaneapp.com/download/preview">visit this download page</a>. Make sure to read the release notes found on the same page.</p>
