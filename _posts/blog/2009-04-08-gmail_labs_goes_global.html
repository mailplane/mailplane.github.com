<p>Hooray! According to the "official Gmail blog" Gmail lab features are now available in all supported Gmail languages - not just English!</p>

<p>Currently, there are 43 different lab features. I love and use these Gmail Lab features:</p>

<ul>
<li>Offline Gmail! <a href="/download.html">If you like to try it, you'll need Mailplane 2.1-beta.</a></li>
<li>Youtube, Picasa, Flickr previews in mail.</li>
<li>Quick Links: Adds a box to the left column that gives you 1-click access to any bookmarkable URL in Gmail. You can use it for saving frequent searches, important individual messages, and more.</li>
<li>Fixed with font: Adds an option to the reply dropdown menu that lets you view a message in fixed width font.</li>
<li>Navbar drag and drop: Allows you to reorder the items in your navbar using drag and drop.</li>
<li>Forgotten attachment detector: Prevents you from accidentally sending messages without the relevant attachments.</li>
<li>Vacation Time: Lets you specify starting and ending dates for the vacation autoresponder.</li>
<li>Custom Label Colors: Lets you create your own combination of colors for labels.</li>
<li>Search Autocomplete: Provides search suggestions for contacts and operators as you type in the search box.</li>
<li>Google Calendar gadget: Adds a box in the left column which shows your Google Calendar. See upcoming events, locations, and details.</li>
<li>Google Docs gadget: Adds a box in the left column which displays your Google Docs. Shows recent docs, starred docs, and has fast search.</li>
<li>Add any gadget by URL: Adds a "Gadgets" tab to Settings, where you'll be able to specify the URL of any gadget. This gadget will show in a box in the left column.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, please do not use these lab features with Mailplane (they are not compatible):</p>

<ul>
<li>Custom keyboard shortcuts</li>
<li>Hide Unread Counts</li>
<li>Any signature feature (if you use Mailplane 2.1-beta HTML signatures).</li>
</ul>
