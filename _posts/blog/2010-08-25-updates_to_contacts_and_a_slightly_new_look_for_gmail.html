<blockquote>
<p>Contacts now works more like the rest of Gmail, so if you know how to use Gmail, now you should automatically feel comfortable in Contacts too. And you'll see a bunch of theÂ <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=184497">features</a> you've requested, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Keyboard shortcuts (go to Contacts and hit "?" for the full list)</li>
<li>Sort by last name (look under "More actions")</li>
<li>Custom labels for phone numbers and other fields</li>
<li>The ability to undo changes you've just made</li>
<li>Automatic saving</li>
<li>Structured name fields, so you can adjust titles, suffixes, and other name components</li>
<li>A bigger, more prominent notes field</li>
</ul>
