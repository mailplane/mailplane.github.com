<p>Mirko Viviani just released Lyn 1.0.2 with Mailplane integration. <a href="http://www.lynapp.com">Lyn is lightweight and fast image browser</a> that natively supports all popular image formats like JPEG, TIFF, JPEG 2000, PNG, TGA, RAW, HDR, OpenEXR, PPM, animated GIF and any other image format supported by Mac OS X.</p>

<p>To email a picture from within Lyn, select some pictures and press the Mail toolbar item. Just make sure Mailplane is your default email client, the setting can be found in <em>Mailplane > Preferences > Advanced.</em></p>
