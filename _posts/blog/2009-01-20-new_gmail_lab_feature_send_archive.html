<p>This feature was requested frequently, and it saves you at least one keystroke or button click per conversation.</p>

<p><a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2009/01/new-in-labs-send-archive.html">From the official Gmail blog:</a></p>

<blockquote>Having clicked "Send" followed by "Archive" a few million times, I started to wish there was a way to just click once and accomplish both actions at the same time. So I decided to turn this idea to a Gmail Labs experiment. Turn on "Send &amp; Archive" from the Labs tab under Settings, and you'll see a new button in the compose form labeled just that. The button does what it says: it sends your reply and then archives the thread with one click. </blockquote>

<p>Tip: The <b>File->Send</b> menu item or &#x2318;&#x21E7;D keyboard shortcut performs the "Send and &amp; Archive" if you have enabled the lab feature.</p>
