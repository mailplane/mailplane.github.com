We came across an awesome article written on [macnews.com](http://macnews.com) reviewing our most recent release of Mailplane 3 which includes an update to use Google's new attachment experience.

The writer at Macnews summarizes by saying "MacTech uses Mailplane internally â€” and wholeheartedly recommends it for your Gmail and Google Calendar experience."

We really appreciate the great review! You can check out the [whole article here](http://www.macnews.com/2013/11/26/kool-tools-mailplane-311).
