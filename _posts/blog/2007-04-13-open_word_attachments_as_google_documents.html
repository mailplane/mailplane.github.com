<p><img class="imageStyle" alt="Open as a Google document" src="http://mailplaneapp.com/files/blog/page5_blog_entry10_1.png" width="378" height="164"/><br />Many people send Word document as attachments, though not everybody has Microsoft Word installed. Sure: They can be viewed as HTML, but now Mailplane integrates with Google documents: Directly import attachments as Google documents and edit them in your preferred browser.<br /><br /><em>Thanks Tim B</em><br /></p>
