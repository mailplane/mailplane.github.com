<p><a href="http://gmailblog.blogspot.com/2011/02/two-improvements-to-contact-groups.html">Google published two Gmail contact group improvements:</a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Organizing your Gmail contacts into groups can save you time when you’re writing messages to multiple people at once. For example, if you create a “Family” group, instead of addressing an email to your mom, dad, sister and brother, you can just start typing “Family” and Gmail will complete the rest. Today we’re making two improvements to contact groups which should make them easier to create and control.</p>

Now, you can paste that list into the Add to group menu when viewing your “Coworkers” group to populate or extend it.</p>

<p>Second, we’ve added the ability to specify which one of your contact’s email addresses you want to use in a given group. So, for example, you can now use your friend’s personal address in your “Poker Buddies” group and that same friend’s work address in your “Coworkers” group.</p>
