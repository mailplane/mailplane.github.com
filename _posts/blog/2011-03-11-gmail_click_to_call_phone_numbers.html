<p>Gmail now detects phone numbers in emails and will convert them to clickable links:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>With the ability to call phones built right into Gmail, you no longer have to get out your phone and retype a number anytime someone sends you one in an email or chat message. Starting today, you’ll see that phone numbers appear as links, like this:</p>

<p>Just click the number, and Gmail’s dialpad will pop up, already populated with the number you’re trying to call.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Click “Call” and voilà! Of course, if you don’t already have the voice and video plugin installed, you’ll be prompted to do that first. </p>

<p>You’ll also see a little green phone icon next to numbers in your contacts which you can use to do the same thing.</p>
