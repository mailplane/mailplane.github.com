Today Wil Gomex from [Mac360.com](http://mac360.com) released a great little review article about Mailplane. We always love reading from our customers' perspective!

Wil Says, "MailPlane makes using Gmail a more unified experience."

He appreciates the ability to open Calendar directly within Mailplane in a tab, being able to attach screenshots directly from within Mailplane and having the option of enabling 'Do not disturb mode' to name a few of his points!
