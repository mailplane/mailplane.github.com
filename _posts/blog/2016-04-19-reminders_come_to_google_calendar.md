Google is adding the option to give yourself a reminder for your Calendar events! This new functionality will work on both your mobile device and your web based version of Gmail.

Google says:

Reminders stick around - If a reminder isn't completed, it will appear at the top of your calendar until you mark it done.

Reminders work across Google - Reminders you create in Inbox, Keep, and the Google app will also show in Google Calendar.

Of course, you can use this feature within Mailplane as well.
