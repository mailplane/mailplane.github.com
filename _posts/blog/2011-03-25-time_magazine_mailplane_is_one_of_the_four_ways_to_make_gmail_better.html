<p>Time magazine's Techland published 'four ways to Make Gmail better'. Among them, Rapportive, 0boxer, Gmail Mobile, and Mailplane:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mailplane. If you use Gmail on a Mac, this utility lets it run like a standalone app rather than a Web site. It's particularly handy if you have more than one Gmail account. $24.95 (after a free trial) and worth it.</p>
