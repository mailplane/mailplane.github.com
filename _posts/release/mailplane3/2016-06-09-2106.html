<p>This update contains a number of improvements and fixes which we already published in 3.6.x versions but now targeted for OS X 10.7, OS X 10.8, OS X 10.9.</p>
<p>We're not able to publish all features on those platforms anymore and Gmail might cease to work there because Google is constantly dropping older systems. Whenever possible we suggest to upgrade to the latest OS X version.</p>

<div class="item">
