<p><a href="http://hci.stanford.edu/mkrieger">Mike Krieger</a> has ported the famous and elegant "Gmail Redesigned" stylesheet to Mailplane! Designed by <a href="http://globexdesigns.com/gmail" rel="self">GlobexDesigns</a>, the stylesheet is part of the "Better Gmail" Firefox extension. It worked in Firefox only and thanks to Mike now in Mailplane, too.<br /><img class="imageStyle" alt="Mailplane for Test-1" src="/assets/blog/Screenshot.png" width="636" height="462"/><br />Please visit the <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/mailplaneapp" rel="self">mailplaneapp</a> Google group to get it. The CSS file is located in the "Files" section and is named "gmail-redesigned-webkit (n).css" (n is the version number).<br /><strong><br /></strong><p></p></p>

<h4>Watch the installation screencast to get started:</h4>

<div class="screencast-link">
<a class="screencast-link" href="/screencasts/entry/install_custom_stylesheet"><img style="float:none;" src="/static/images/screencasts_xlarge.png" alt="Screencasts"/></a>
<br/>
<a class="screencast-link" href="/screencasts/entry/install_custom_stylesheet">Watch Screencast</a>
</div>

<hr class="space"/>

<p><strong>Important:</strong> As the stylesheet is maintained by Mike, please post your suggestions, problems, and feedback to the mailplaneapp Google group.</p>
