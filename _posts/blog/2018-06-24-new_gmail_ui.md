Google started rolling-out a new face for Gmail last month.

[The new Gmail UI](https://support.google.com/a/answer/7684334) allows you to organize emails directly from your inbox, snooze emails until later, use suggested replies and work offline in Gmail. If you're interested, read about [their timeline here](https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2018/06/new-gmail-timeline.html).

With the exception of "[offline work](https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2018/05/work-offline-in-new-gmail.html)", Mailplane supports the new UI. Make sure to **use at least [Mailplane 3.8.0](/releases/mailplane3.html#3354)** before you make the switch.

"[Offline work](https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2018/05/work-offline-in-new-gmail.html)" requires a Chrome browser and thus, Mailplane 3 won't be able to support it because it is Safari WebKit based. But hold on a few weeks. We're working on it.
