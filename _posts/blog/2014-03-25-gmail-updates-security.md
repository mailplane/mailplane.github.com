Starting last week, Gmail has made your email even more secure. Although Gmail has already used a secure HTTPS connection, the new update makes sure your emails are also encrypted when traveling directly within Google's data centers.

What does it all mean? Well, it means that you don't have to worry about anyone listening in on your messages no matter where you are (home, work, public wifi...) or what you're on (computer, phone, tablet...). Of course, this will not protect you from Google itself and will not hold law enforcement agencies back from requesting access to your data. But encrypting while traveling within Google's data centers makes it harder for anyone outside of Google to intercept information on their servers.

Other ways to stay safe is to ensure you are using a strong password and you can use [2-step-verification log in](https://mailplaneapp.com/howto/entry/two_factor_authentication) directly within Mailplane.
