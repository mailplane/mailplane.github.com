<p>Priority Inbox got some improvements:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It's been a couple of months since we first launched Priority Inbox. Since then, we’ve heard from a number of you who’ve found it helpful in combating information overload, and we’ve seen evidence of this in aggregate too. Looking at median time in conversation view, we noticed that typical Priority Inbox users spend 43% more time reading important mail compared to unimportant, and 15% less time reading email overall as compared to Gmail users who don’t use Priority Inbox. We’re excited about the impact Priority Inbox can have, and we’re listening to your feedback in order to make it even better. </p>

<p>For example, one thing we heard is that you wanted to know why Gmail classifies certain messages as important. So starting today, when you hover over an <a href="http://mail.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=186535">importance marker</a> you’ll see a short explanation (e.g. “Important because you marked it as important” or “Important mainly because of the people in the conversation.”). </p>

<p>You also told us that you thought Priority Inbox didn’t learn fast enough, so we've made it much more responsive to your manual corrections.</p>

<p>If you have more ideas for improvements, please share them with us on our new <a href="https://www.google.com/moderator/#16/e=3c100">product ideas page</a> — or just vote on ideas that others suggest. Your feedback will help us make Priority Inbox work for even more Gmail users.</p>
