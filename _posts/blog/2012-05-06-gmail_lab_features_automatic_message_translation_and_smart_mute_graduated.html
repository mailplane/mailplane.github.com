<p>Google has graduated (they are now part of Gmail) three lab features. </p>

<ul>
<li>Automatic Message Translation</li>
<li>Title Tweaks</li>
<li>Smart Mute</li>
</ul>

<p>I like the "Automatic Message Translation" most :)</p>

<p>Other lab feature were less successful and have been retired:</p>

<ul>
<li>Old Snakey </li>
<li>Mail Goggles</li>
<li>Mouse Gestures</li>
<li>Hide Unread Counts</li>
<li>Move Icon Column</li>
<li>Inbox Preview</li>
<li>Custom Date Format</li>
<li>SMS in Chat gadget (SMS is still working, but the lab feature has been removed).</li>
</ul>
