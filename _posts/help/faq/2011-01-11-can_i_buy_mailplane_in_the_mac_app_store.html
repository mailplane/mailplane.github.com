<p>Unfortunately no. Never say never, but we don't have plans yet to sell Mailplane 3 via the App Store.</p>

<p>We love the App Store but it's not a perfect fit for every application. Mailplane is a niche application which deeply integrates with Google services, especially Gmail. To prevent painting ourselves into a corner we need as much flexibility as possible. Either in terms of technical approaches or in terms of timely updates. And we are a very small team and thus, we need to keep the complexity as low as possible. Selling through two different channels can be quite time consuming.</p>

<p>The App Store maintains a high level of privacy. We appreciate that as customers as well. But selling through our own webstore gives us much more possibilities to make our customers happy. We can provide hassle free trial periods, grant as many refunds as we like and sell upgrades. No middleman. No questions asked. Just you and us.</p>

<p>We hope for your understanding and we try everything to make it as hassle-free as possible for you. Write us to <a href="mailto:support@mailplaneapp.com">support@mailplaneapp.com</a> if you lost your license or if you have any other issues. We're here for you!</p>
