<p><div class="image-left"><img class="imageStyle" alt="MailplaneIcon" src="/assets/blog/page5_blog_entry12_1.png" width="128" height="128"/></div>Mailplane has a new application icon! The unread message count badge has been improved, too. <br /><br />Many kudos to professional icon designer <a href="http://jonas.seph.ws/" rel="self">Jonas Rask</a>. He created the icon and badge. I hope you like it as much as I do!<br /><br /></p>
