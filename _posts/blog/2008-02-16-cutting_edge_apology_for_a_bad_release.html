<p>The "cutting edge" version (1.71.5) published yesterday, was a bad release. Some users reported that it just didn't start after the update procedure. It looks like only MAC OS X Tiger users were affected by the problem.<br /><br />The error has now been fixed, and a new update has been released a minute ago. Use the "Check for updates" feature to load it.<br /><br />If your Mailplane doesn't start, you need to download the latest version manually: Please use the <a href="/download" rel="self" title="Download">download page</a> to either download the stable or "cutting edge" version.<br /><br />I deeply apologize for any inconveniences this might have caused, and I will work hard to make sure I reduce the likelihood of this happening again. <br /></p>
