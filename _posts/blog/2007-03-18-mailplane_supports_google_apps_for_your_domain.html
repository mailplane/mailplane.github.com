<p><img class="imageStyle" alt="GAFYD-in-Mailplane" src="/assets/blog/page5_blog_entry3_1.png" width="628" height="236"/><br />I like to keep everyone informed about the progress we make in the private beta. When something major is accomplished, I will publish it on this blog. <br /><br />As many people have asked for it, I feel this improvement needs to be mentioned: Mailplane now works successfully with both regular Gmail and "Google apps for your domain" accounts. <br /></p>
