<p>Google mail is about a "different approach to email". Most of its unique features are lost by using IMAP. I love to "Google search" my emails, see all relevant posts in the conversation view, use labels instead of folders, see the virus scanner at work, chat with Google Talk etc.<br /><br />Mailplane is about combining this "different approach to email" with desktop features found in email applications such as Mail.app or Thunderbird.<br />Here is my <a href="http://mailplaneapp.com/blog/entry/google_announces_imap_for_gmail/" rel="self" title="Blog: Google announces IMAP for Gmail">blog post</a> about the subject.</p>
