[Google retired](https://gsuiteupdates.googleblog.com/2017/03/updates-in-g-suite-to-streamline-hangouts-and-gmail.html) the "Quick Links" and "Quote Selected Text" lab features in Gmail.

We heard a lot of customers complaining and so we went ahead and implemented both features in [Mailplane 3.7.0](/releases/mailplane3.html#3238).

**Quick Links:** We call it Bookmarks in Mailplane. Use "Mail > Go to > Add Bookmark..." (⇧-⌘-B) to save frequent searches or links to individual messages in Gmail and navigate to them via "Mail > Go to > Navigate..." (⌥-⌘-G).

**Quote Selected Text:** Simply select some text in Mailplane and press either "Mail > Reply" (⌘-R) or "Mail > Reply All" (⌥-⌘-R).
