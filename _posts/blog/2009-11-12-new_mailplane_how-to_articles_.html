<p>Mailplane offers more than one might realize. The new "how-to" documentation can help you get more out of Mailplane. Each how-to article comes with screenshots and step by step instructions.</p>

<p>You find the articles <a href="https://mailplaneapp.com/howto" target="_blank">in support section of the mailplaneapp.com website</a> or by opening the online help: (Use the <em>Help > Mailplane Help</em> menu item to access it).</p>

<p>As a start over a dozen articles have been published. Over the next few days, more will follow. I plan to cover all new 2.1 features and focus on some getting started topics. If you miss a particular article, <a href="https://mailplaneapp.com/contact" target="_blank">please suggest it.</a></p>
