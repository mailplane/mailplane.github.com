We hope you've been enjoying Mailplane over the past few years. We're happy to officially announce the release of Mailplane 4 today. It is a major update to our popular macOS application for Gmail, Calendar, Contacts & Google Inbox.

Mailplane 4 is packed with new features and looks better than ever. Check out some of its new features [here](/mailplane_4_what_is_new.html)!

If you bought Mailplane 3 in 2018, you'll get a free upgrade. All existing customers are eligible for an upgrade discount.

The upgrade fee is $19.95 for a personal license and $24.95 for a family license. For site licenses, the fee is $19.95 per seat; benefit from a volume discount starting at three seats.

Make sure you run at least macOS Sierra (10.12). Update via Mailplane 3 (3.8.0 or higher) or [download Mailplane 4](https://update.mailplaneapp.com/mailplane_4.php) and enter your Mailplane 3 license to get the upgrade discount.

Thanks again for your support over the years. We're grateful to be able to continue doing what we love - and that's only possible thanks to our loyal customer base.

Ruben & Lars
