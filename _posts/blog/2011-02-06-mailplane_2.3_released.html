<p>0Boxer is a plugin for Gmail. It turns "inbox zero" into a game. You get points when you answer, archive, or delete email.</p>

<h3>NEW: Improved External URLs</h3>

<ol>
<li>All links inside a window opened with Command-Click open inside Mailplane instead of your default web browser.</li>
<li>For security reasons: When a window contains 'non-Gmail' content, the URL is displayed in the status bar.</li>
</ol>

<h3>NEW: New message window title now contains the account name</h3>
