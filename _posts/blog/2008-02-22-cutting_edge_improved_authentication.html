<p>As the authentication code and dialog box were modal, no "check for updates" could be performed before Google authentication. <br /><br />The authentication part of Mailplane is now completely new: Mailplane will automatically check for updates, even if you can't sign in. <br />The dialog is now a "dialog sheet" attached to the main window, and the login procedure can be cancelled at any time.<br /><br />Plus: If you have many accounts, startup is now much faster.<br /></p>
