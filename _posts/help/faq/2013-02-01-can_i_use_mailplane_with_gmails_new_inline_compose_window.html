Mailplane 2.5.x currently does not support Gmail's new inline compose window.  You will have to revert to the old compose window (See screen shot below) to ensure Mailplane is running bug free.

<br>

Please know that we will not let Mailplane 2 'die' if Google drops the old compose permanently.  We we try our very best to find a solution, though we cannot guarantee that it will run without some restrictions. <BR>
We will also be releasing Mailplane 3 in April 2013, which does support the new compose window.<br>
