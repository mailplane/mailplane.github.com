Apple released macOS Catalina (10.15) last month. Mailplane [4.1.4](https://mailplaneapp.com/releases/mailplane4.html#4752) runs well on it.

You can read a bit about the new features of macOS Catalina [here](https://www.apple.com/osx).

Attachment downloads didn't work in Mailplane 3 off the bat but we did release an update today. Please do check for updates via "Mailplane 3 > Check for Updates..." or grab the latest version from our [download page](https://mailplaneapp.com/download).

Although Mailplane 3 runs on macOS Catalina, this will be the last forecasted update to Mailplane 3. Thank you for your understanding.
