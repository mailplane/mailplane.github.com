<p>Seth Smith just reviewed Mailplane on the <a href="http://appyourmac.com">AppYourMac</a> site:</p>

<blockquote>
Mailplane offers lots of features to make your life easier when it comes to emailing. One of my favorite features is, the function of being easily create attachments by a simple drag and drop method. If you like attaching photoâ€™s or other files, this feature really does come in handy. Another great feature of Mailplane is that you are able to switch between Gmail accounts fast and with no hassle. I myself have about four Gmail accounts and I now have them all synced with Mailplane, it is so much easier to switch between them now that I am using this application. Of course Mailplane stores all of your passwords on a keychain, so once again it saves your time.
