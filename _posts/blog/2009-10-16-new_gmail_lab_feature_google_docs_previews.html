<p>If you're a Google docs user, you may like the preview lab feature:</p>

<p>Being an avid Google Docs user, I receive a ton of emails with links to documents that my co-workers and friends share with me. From technical design documents at work to my roommate's expenses spreadsheet, my inbox is full of document links that I need to view as I reply to my mail.
</p>
<p>Opening these links in another tab or window is kind of annoying, plus it can be tough to keep the context of the email in mind while viewing the document.
</p>
<p>Starting today, you can preview the contents of a Google document, spreadsheet, or presentation right in your Gmail inbox — just like you've already been able to do with YouTube videos, Yelp reviews, and Picasa and Flickr albums. Gmail will automatically detect when you receive a document link and display the name and type of doc below the email.
</p>

<p>Just click "Show preview" and the contents of the document will display right there — no need to switch back and forth between email response and document.
