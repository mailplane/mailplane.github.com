In October last year, Google [announced new guidelines](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/g-suite/elevating-user-trust-in-our-api-ecosystems) for its Gmail API. Applications accessing data via that API had to be verified by Google to ensure compliance with their new privacy and security requirements.

Mailplane uses the Gmail API for search everywhere functionality, navigation, image annotation, notifier actions, and most save clip options. Everything runs between your Mac and Google and no server of us is involved.

We're happy to announce that the review was successful and we can continue to provide these functionalities without limitations.
