	<p>This update contains a number of improvements and fixes for OS X 10.7, OS X 10.8 and OS X 10.9 platforms. <a href="http://www.mailplaneapp.com/releases/mailplane3.html#2106" target="_blank">More...</a></p>
	<p>Keep in mind that we're not able to publish all features on those platforms anymore and Gmail might cease to work there because Google is constantly dropping older systems. Whenever possible we suggest to upgrade to the latest OS X version.</p>
	<p><strong>Attention:</strong> Customers who already downloaded 3.6.0 will lose Google Inbox support. Unfortunately we're not able to officially support it anymore on platforms lower than OS X 10.10. We suggest to update to the latest OS X version if you'd like to continue using Google Inbox.</p>
