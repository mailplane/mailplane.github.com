<p><p>Early 1984 two milestones were unfolded on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean. Europe was first with the launch of the 32bit multitasking/multi-windowing Sinclair QL. 12 days later America saw the launch of the 32bit GUI Apple Macintosh. Because of this anniversary, the Sinclair QL community has organized the <a href="http://www.qlvsjaguar.homepage.bluewin.ch/index_frames.html" target="_blank">International "QL &amp; Mac are 25" event.</a>

<p>I'll giving a talk about the Mac OS X, it's recent history, and about Cocoa development on the Mac and the iPhone. <strong>The title of the talk: "The Mac died nine years ago."</strong>. Don't worry, it was a good thing after all. Back in 2000 Mac OS 9 was outdated (remember the Mac bomb and crashes?) and Macs were slower than comparable PCs or Unix workstations. But everything changed when NeXTstep morphed to Mac OS X and later Macs got Intel processors. Would an iPhone have been possible without NeXTstep? Would we have a 64bit Mac OS?</p>
